    <p>Welcome to <mark>the random book club</mark>; a small, but life-long project to collect ideas from the stacks of books I have accumulated over the years.</p>
    <p>This site is intended to be used as a reference for myself and others, and was originally created as a way to help myself recover from an injury that harmed my short-term memory (since I suddenly could not trust my ability to recall information correctly). Each book has the specific edition I have read and every passage has the orginal page number it was found on to help with referencing. Thank you for visiting.</p>
