    <h1>The Random Book Club</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <mark>the random book club</mark>; a small, but life-long project to collect ideas from the stacks of books I have accumulated over the years.</p>
    <p>This site was originally created as a reference for myself and as a way to help recover from an injury that harmed my short-term memory (since I suddenly could not trust my ability to recall information correctly). Each book listed below has the specific edition I have read and every passage has the orginal page number it was found on to help with referencing.</p>
