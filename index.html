    <p>Welcome to <mark>the random book club</mark>; a small, but life-long project to collect ideas from the stacks of books I have accumulated over the years.</p>
    <p>This site was originally created as a tool to help myself recover from an injury that harmed my short-term memory, since I suddenly could not trust my ability to recall information correctly. As the years went by my memory started to improve but I had built the habit of keeping dozens of notebooks with me everywhere I went. I filled them  with anything that caught my attention from any book I came across. Today, this site is intended to be used as a reference for myself and others; and to finally replace all my worn-out notebooks. Each book has the specific edition I have documented and every passage has the orginal page number it was found on. Thank you for visiting.</p>
