      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Just remember that your real job is that if you are free, you need to free somebody else. If you have some power, then your job is to empower somebody else. -Toni Morrison</p>
      <p>Leadership, at its core, isn't about you. Instead, it's about how effective you are at empowering other people and unleashing their full potential. [2]</p>
      <p>The practice of leadership almost always asks you to risk something, but it only sometimes requires a midnight ride or a clutch, buzzer-beating jump shot. And there's rarely a crowd that goes wild when you get it right. [4]</p>
      <p><mark>Leadership, at its core, isn't about you. It's about how effective you are at unleashing other people. Full stop. That's it. That's the secret. [4]</mark></p>
      <p>Your job as a leader is to create the conditions for the people around you to become increasingly effective, to help them fully realize their own capacity and power. And not only when you're in the trenches with them, but also when you're not around. [5]</p>
      <p>She shifted her focus going forward from what she needed to be successful as a leader to what she needed to do to help others succeed. [5]</p>
      <p>The strengths and potential of the people around you become your greatest assets.[7]</p>
      <p>Leadership is built on the assumption that tomorrow can be better than today. If you have a hard time buying into such a romantic idea, if you dismiss it along with rainbows and unicorns, then we suggest you try your hand at something else. Despair is the opposite of leadership. [7]</p>
      <p><mark>Hoffman put it this way: "As a leader, you have to constantly shut off your own reel and watch all the movies playing around you." [9]</mark></p>
      <p>The central questions of leadership have little to do with your own performance as a leader (how'd I do?) and almost everything to do with the performance of others (how'd they do?). [9]</p>
      <p><mark>Why did you miss the chance to fully empower another person or team or organization? The answer we hear most often is that you made it somehow about you. You turned inward rather than outward, directing energy toward your own hopes and fears, rather than those of your team. [11]</mark></p>
      <p>You're going to have a manager. Your manager's important but they're not with you all day long. What you're doing with your time is your choice, and the impact you have is driven by your decisions. [14]</p>
      <p>If our ambition was to lead, then we were asking the wrong question. The relevant question wasn't "What do these people think of me?", it was "What can I do to help make these people better?" [19]</p>
      <p>You can improve yourself or the people around you, but it's difficult to do both at the same time. We advise being intentional about this distinction and doing the work on you away from the office. [21]</p>
      <p><mark>Only when you can imagine a better version of someone can you play a role in helping to unleash them. If you don't have confidence in someone's growth potential, then you can do many things with that person, but leading isn't one of them. [22]</mark></p>
      <p>We also advise you to be direct. Sit someone down and tell them about the strengths you've observed, being as sincere and specific as you can in your descriptions. Use dates, times, and details, illustrating the positive impacts of their behavior on you and others. [22]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>Part One - Trust</h2>
    <p><mark>Under pressure, we often double down on behaviors that undermine trust. [35]</mark></p>
    <p>From the skeptic's perspective, which got wobbly on you? Did they think you might be putting your own interests first? Did the interaction feel all about you? That's an empathy block. Did they question the rigor of your analysis or your ability to execute on an ambitious plan? That's a logic problem. Or did they think you might be misrepresenting some part of your story, exaggerating the upside or downplaying the risks? That's an authenticity issue. [36]</p>
    <p>What do your typical wobbles and anchors seem to be? Does the pattern change under stress or with different kinds of stakeholders? For example, do you wobble in one way with your direct reports, but in a different way with people who have authority over you (this isn't uncommon)? [38]</p>
    <p>If people think you're primarily in it for you, then they're far less willing to be led by you. [39]</p>
    <p>Empathy wobbles are common among people who are analytical and driven to learn. [39]</p>
    <p>We advise empathy wobblers to pay close attention to their behavior in group settings, particularly when other people have the floor. [40]</p>
    <p>An empathy wobbler's engagement tends to be sky high at the kickoff of a meeting (you might learn something!) until the moment they understand the concepts and contribute their ideas. At this point, their engagement plummets and remains low until the gathering mercifully comes to an end. We call this dramatic are the "agony of the super smart” (or ASS). [40]</p>
    <p><mark>You could flamboyantly multitask, or find ways to look bored, or look down at your phone the first chance you get. Anything to make it clear that this meeting is beneath you. Unfortunately, the cost of these indulgences is trust. [40]</mark></p>
    <p>If you signal that you matter more than everyone else, then you can do many things, but being trusted as a leader isn't one of them. [40]</p>
    <p><mark>The prescription is easy to describe, but harder to execute: change your objective from getting what you need in the meeting to making sure everyone else gets what they need. [40]</mark></p>
    <p>The antidote to an empathy wobble is presence. [40]</p>
    <p>Americans have become convinced that a growing number of companies are in it solely to enrich themselves, not to be of service to their customers [42]</p>
    <p>Never forget that investing in people has the possibility of infinite returns. [43]</p>
    <p>In this country's founding documents, we promised to defend each other's pursuit of happiness- not happiness itself, but the pursuit of it-as a sacred, inalienable right. Until we treat that promise with reverence again, we're not going to solve our collective trust problem. [44]</p>
    <p>There is no higher human need than to realize our full potential, and no greater act of empathy than to enable that evolution in others. [44]</p>
    <p><mark>In the rare cases when wobbly logic is truly the problem, we advise going back to the data. Root the case you're making in evidence, speak to the things you know to be true, and then (and this is the hard part) stop there. One reason Larry Bird was such an extraordinary basketball player was that he only took shots he knew he could reliably make. That choice made him different from so many other players, who often let ego and adrenaline cloud their shooting judgment. [45]</mark></p>
    <p>Other people's insights are among the most valuable-_and overlooked--resources in the workplace, but accessing them requires a willingness to reveal you don't have all the answers, something leaders often resist. [45]</p>
    <p>Simply populating your team with diverse perspectives and experiences doesn't always translate into better performance. [48]</p>
    <p>The common information effect.'S It works like this: As human beings, we tend to focus on the things we have in common with other people. We tend to seek out and affirm our shared knowledge, as it confirms our value and kinship with the group. [48]</p>
    <p><mark>Pay less attention to what you think people want to hear and more attention to what you need to say to them. [50]</mark></p>
    <p>You may not be taking care of yourself with enough empathy and compassion. As we explored in chapter 1, until you can reliably meet your own needs, you won't have the strength to be an effective leader and unleash anyone else. [57]</p>

    <h2>Part One - Love</h2>
    <p>Leaders should aim for high marks on both ideals, embodied by justice in the upper right. They should convey both commanding authority and a profound sense of duty to their fellow human beings. [61]</p>
    <p>When a leader's expectations are high and clear, we tend to stretch to reach them. [62]</p>
    <p><mark>We embrace justice when the conditions are optimal-when we've slept well, or we're not under pressure, or when it doesn't require too much discomfort or deviation from our preferred patterns of behavior--but this convergence of circumstances rarely coincides with our biggest opportunities to lead. The thing that will matter most, hands down, to your ability to empower others is the capacity to move into justice whenever it will make a difference. [71]</mark></p>
    <p>She advises focusing on a child's effort ("you worked so hard!"), something within their control, rather than innate traits ("you're so smart!") that ratchet up the stakes of failure and undermine the drive to take risks and improve. [73]</p>
    <p>Are you asking your people to evolve? Or are you instead- because of loyalty or complacency or conflict avoidance-asking relatively little of them? Are you empowering others or are you making them comfortable? [73]</p>
    <p>Sincere but nonspecific praise is easier to dispense, but it rarely helps someone improve, since they're not entirely sure how to recreate the magic. [74]</p>
    <p>In the absence of empathy, constructive advice can easily become destructive, making the recipient worse rather than better. [75]</p>
    <p>It's positive reinforcement that gets the job done, the most powerful accelerant we've observed for helping human beings scramble up a learning curve. [75]</p>
    <p>Here's the part that surprises most people: the right ratio of positive to constructive is at least 5:1. For every unit of constructive advice you decide to hand out, the recipient should ideally receive five units of positive reinforcement. [76]</p>
    <p><mark>Your performance metric is someone else's improvement. If you're not seeing improvement, then it's your job to try another way. [76]</mark></p>
    <p>Discover what people dread doing and reduce their pain. Easy wins in most organizations include streamlining reporting and optimizing performance reviews, but stay humble and curious in this process. Assume you don't know everything that's draining your team's time or all of the latest tools that could help. [80]</p>
    <p>When you find yourself in neglect, you essentially have two choices: invest in the relationship or respectfully sever it. Staying in neglect with people is generally a toxic choice, for you and everyone else. [81]</p>
    <p>Proactively help (without the asking part). Pick someone on your team whose proverbial "plate" you know well (ideally, because you've piled things onto it) and surprise them by removing something. Show them you get it by choosing some thing that's causing particular frustration and/or is misaligned with their long-term goals. [83]</p>
    <p>It's not free: to make others better comes at a price for the giver. [87]</p>

      <h2>Part One - Belonging</h2>
      <p>If you want to attract different types of people, then start meeting them where they are, in different types of places (ideally, where they're the majority). [96]</p>
      <p>Be wary of squishy, subjective standards such as "best athlete" and "cultural fit," which live almost entirely in the eyes of overconfident beholders. [102]</p>
      <p>Recognize our very human propensity to have preferences that may diverge from the company's best interest, and save us from ourselves with dispassionate selection guidelines. Define the selection bar as clearly as you can, and then--like Cammie Dunaway- refuse to lower it. [102]</p>
      <p>Some leaders resist the concept of development, preferring a "sink or swim" approach rooted in the following logic: hire as well as you can, make the job requirements clear, largely leave people alone to figure out how to thrive, and may the best people win. The idea here is that a healthy meritocracy is a substitute for development, with the added kicker of helping you sort the strong from the weak. This approach may seem reasonable on the surface, but it tends to get wobbly in execution. One reason is that informal development is happening all of the time, whether or not you code it as such. And it is rarely distributed fairly: some of your best "swimmers" have easy access to it, while other people, as a colleague of ours recently characterized, are experiencing a daily ice-bucket challenge. What's worse, we often throw people who are different from us into the deep end, without realizing how much informal scaffolding we're giving to people who are like us, in ways we sometimes don't recognize as developmental, [109–112]</p>
      <p>As achievement-oriented creatures, many of your best people are thinking about promotion, some of them all the time, and making us guess at what it will take is not in the company's best interest. [114]</p>
      <p>We found a trend that surprised us: overall, women were holding on to draft manuscripts for extended periods of time--often for a year or more--before submitting them for publication. And while they were polishing their work toward an relentless goal of perfection, their male counterparts were submitting works in progress early and often, getting critical feedback on their ideas and shortening the timeline to a publication's ultimate acceptance. They weren't letting perfectionism get in the way of participating in the industry's cycle of feedback and improvement. [115-116]</p>
      <p><mark>Individual impact still mattered, but just as important was how much someone contributed to other people's success. [116]</mark></p>
      <p>Consider making the feedback we give others part of our own evaluation. If someone rates everyone the same, then they're not doing a good job. If the differences are arbitrary or retaliatory, then they're not doing a good job. And if their ratings are thoughtful, evidence-based, self-aware, and sensitive to institutional context, then they should be celebrated for their contributions. [118]</p>
      <p>For constructive advice to be productive, it must be layered on top of a foundation of trust. [119]</p>
      <p><mark>Earn the right to keep your people, every single day. [120]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>One straight-forward challenge we see is the burdening of marginalized groups with a "representation tax" on their workload. Asking the same group of people to sit on hiring committees and be visible when important stakeholders are in town can backfire if it means they're doing significantly more uncredited work than their colleagues. [120]</mark></p>
      <p>Promotion doesn't heal all wounds. Your work is not done when you give someone a corner office and a bottle of champagne. [121]</p>
      <p><mark>Attract great people, give them interesting work to do, and invest in them as if your company's future depends on it. [121]</mark></p>

      <h2>Part Two - Strategy</h2>
      <p>You have two very powerful leadership levers that do not require you to be any where near the action. Strategy and culture. [132]</p>
      <p>Most successful leaders spend a disproportionate amount of time getting strategy and culture right--and broadcasting both to every far-flung corner of the company. [132]</p>
      <p>Strategy is a direct extension of who you are as a leader. Strategy embeds your own values and beliefs into your organization's behavior. [135]</p>
      <p>The component parts of strategy vary by industry, but the key inputs are typically customers, competitors, and suppliers- the external stake-holders whose decisions can make or break you! We'll reveal up front that we’re going to make the controversial choice to put your employees on this list, too. [136]</p>
      <p><mark>Your first job as a strategist is to be better than your competitors at the things that matter most to your customers. [136]</mark></p>
      <p>This means you'll also have to be worse than your competitors at other things, ideally the less important ones. [136]</p>
      <p><mark>Organizations that resist and try to be great at everything usually end up in a state of "exhausted mediocrity." [136]</mark></p>
      <p>We suggest underinvesting where it matters least in order to free up the resources to over-invest where it matters most. [136]</p>
      <p>The most successful leaders constantly make trade-offs like these, often describing their workdays as relentless exercises in prioritization. They accept that they can only do some things well, and so they choose to do the most important ones. [139]</p>
      <p>The idea here is to be bad, to be downright dreadful, at the things that don't matter in order to be excellent at the things that do. This takes courage and a willingness to give up the fantasy of unlimited capacity. [141]</p>
      <p><mark>Building trust, maintaining high standards and deep devotion, unleashing the potential of more and varied people: these are nontrivial challenges. If you want to excel at them, do us all a favor and please be bad at something else. [141]</mark></p>
      <p>In order to attract customers and stay in business, your price should live somewhere between WTP and cost. If your price is higher than WTP, even a penny over, then your customers will walk. If your price is lower than cost, even a penny lower, then you're losing money rather than making it, threatening your existential lifeline as a business. [142]</p>
      <p><mark>Create more value than you capture. [143]</mark></p>
      <p>Costing works best with an understanding of supplier willingness to sell (WTS). WIS is the lowest amount a supplier is willing to accept for their goods and services. If the amount you offer is lower than your suppliers' WTS, even a penny under, they'll walk. [144]</p>
      <p>We don't advise squeezing until it hurts for the simple reason that it's a lot harder to sustain your company's health without happy, prosperous suppliers. They generally aren't going to stick around or work hard for you if they're not rewarded for it. [145]</p>
      <p>Get very clear on the fact that most people will be making most of their decisions without you. How will you design a strategy that will lead them in your absence? How will that strategy reflect who you are as a leader? [154]</p>
      <p><mark>Great strategy is creative, innovative, and above all, optimistic. [154]</mark></p>
      <p>Strategy guides discretionary behavior to the limit of how well you communicate it. [157]</p>
      <p><mark>Understand deeply so that you can describe simply. [157]</mark></p>
      <p>Writing is also the greatest tool for sorting out our own thoughts that human beings have invented. [158]</p>
      <p>The little red book's storyline honored the past, articulated a change mandate, and provided an optimistic way forward, a three-part structure we have seen work again and again in turnaround situations. [159]</p>
      <p>Most strategies have an expiration date, as conditions evolve and your good intentions get roughed up by reality. The minute your competitors improve their products, that attribute map is out of date. As soon as your suppliers innovate or your customers switch up their buying criteria, the borders on your value stick become fluid again. Many companies have an annual strategic planning rite, but 365 days is a very long time to wait to adapt to changes in the behavior of your most critical stakeholders. [162]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Part Two - Culture </h2>
      <p>Whatever strategy has not made clear to your extended team, culture will unapologetically fill the void. Culture establishes the rules of engagement after leadership leaves the room; it explains how things are really done around here. [165]</p>
      <p>Culture tells us how to behave in a meeting. It tells us who gets to take up space automatically and who has to work for it. It tells us whether we should follow the rules or cut corners, whether we should share or hoard information. [165]</p>
      <p>Culture carries its guidance to the farthest corners of the organization to places you may never go and people you may never meet. [165]</p>
      <p>If you could change anything about your culture, what would it be? Is there more than one thing on the list? [167]</p>
      <p>Have the mental flexibility to pivot when your learned assumptions diverge from the behavioral requirements of the organization. [176]</p>
      <p>Select the indicators to use to hold ourselves accountable for progress. [186]</p>
      <p><mark>If you could change anything about your firm's culture, what would it be? Which behaviors or underlying attitudes are getting in the way of your organization's success? [192]</mark></p>
