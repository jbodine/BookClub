      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In the doldrums of the early 1970’s, when I first took over at Magellan. At that low point, demoralized investors had to remind themselves that bear markets don’t last forever, and those with patients held on to their stocks and mutual funds for the fifteen years it took the Dow and other averages to regain the prices reached in the mid-1960s. Today it’s worth reminding ourselves that bull markets don’t last forever and that patients is required in both directions. [p.10]</p>
      <p>Before the internet came along companies had to grow their way into the billion-dollar ranks. Now they can reach billion-dollar valuations before they’ve turned a profit or, in some cases, before they’ve collected any revenues. [p.11]</p>
