      <p>I think of the mind/ brain as more akin to a violin string that has gone slightly out of tune. In this situation, we don't label the instrument as defective and throw it away, but instead listen to what is wrong and tighten (or loosen) the strings a bit so we can continue making music.

      <p>Anxiety and its close cousin, panic are both born from fear [p.15]</p>
