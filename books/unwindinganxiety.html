      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>I think of the mind/ brain as more akin to a violin string that has gone slightly out of tune. In this situation, we don't label the instrument as defective and throw it away, but instead listen to what is wrong and tighten (or loosen) the strings a bit so we can continue making music. [6]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>Anxiety and its close cousin, panic are both born from fear [15]</p>
      <p>Fear's main evolutinary function is helping us survive. [15]</p>
      <p>Fear teaches us to avoid dangerous situations in the future through a brain process called negative reinforcement. [15]<p>
      <p>Anxiety is born when our PFCs don't have enough information to accurately predict the future. [16]</p>
      <p>Notice how fear itself does not equal anxiety. Fear is an adaptive learning mechanism that helps us survive. Anxiety, on the other hand, is maladaptive; our thinking and planning brain spins out of control when it doesn't have enough information. [17]</p>
      <p>With each bit of uncertain information, the brain spins out every conceivable what-if scenario. [22]</p>
      <p>Our own anxiety can be cued/triggered simply by talking to someone else who is anxious. [23]</p>
      <p>We must become aware of two things: that we are getting anxious and/or panicking and what results from anxiety/panicking. [24]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p><mark>Undeterred by modern medicine, anxiety disorders top the charts as the most predominant psychiatric conditions. [33]</mark></p>
      <p>By combining the reward-based learning built into our old brain with intermittent reinforcement and immediate availability, we've created a dangerous formula for modern-day habits and addictions that goes well beyond what we typically think of as substance abuse. [36]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      <p>There are two main downsides to worry. First, if the worrying mind doesn't come up with a solution, worry triggers anxiety, which triggers more worry, and so on. Second, if worry is triggered by anxiety alone, there might not be something specific to worry about. [41]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      <p><mark>First gear is all about recognizing our habit loops and seeing the different components clearly: trigger, behavior, and reward. [57]</mark></p>
      <p>A hook (a problem to be solved and intrigue about how it can be done). [63]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
      <p>Our brains are set up to form habits so we can free up the brain space to learn new things. [65]</p>
      <p><mark>If you aren't aware that you're doing something habitually, you will continue to do it habitually. [71]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>The adage "don't just do something, sit there" also serves as a powerful reminder that being is the doing. In other words, by being there, deeply listening to my patients, I am often doing the best thing I can do for them in that moment: empathizing, understanding, and connecting. [74]</mark></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
      <p><mark>Our brains set up habit loops through reward-based learning. In other words, if a behavior is rewarding, we learn to do it again. [77]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>How rewarding a behavior is drives future behaviors, not the behavior itself. Another way of putting this is that the behavior itself is less important than the result of the behavior. [77]</mark></p>
      <p>My PhD mentor, Dr. Louis Muglia, taught me the phrase "true, true, and unrelated." This was his reminder to me when performing experiments in the lab to check for a chain of causality. In other words, I could be studying behavior or process X and seeing Y happen, yet had to prove (to myself, my mentor, and the world) that X caused Y. X could be happening (true). Y could be happening at the same time or right afterward (true). But that didn't prove that X caused Y to happen. [79]</p>
      <p><mark>Knowing why something became a habit isn't going to magically fix it in the present moment. In fact, triggers are the least important part of the habit loop. Reward-based learning is based on rewards, not the triggers (hence the name). [83]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
      <p><mark>If we aren't aware that we're doing something habitually, we will continue to do it habitually. [84]</mark></p>
      <p>Mindfulness is not about stopping, emptying, or ridding ourselves of anything. Thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations are what make us human. And thinking and planning are both crucial things to master. [86]</p>
      <p>Mindfulness is about changing our relationship to those thoughts and emotions. [86]</p>
      <p>The familiarity of a mood state contributes to our staying in it. When we are sad or anxious all the time, that sadness or anxiety becomes familiar, a place that we gravitate toward, something like a morning routine or a regular route to work. Any deviation feels unfamiliar, perhaps scary or even anxiety-provoking. [89]</p>
      <p><mark>Not all habits are bad. They become bad only when they are tripping us up or slowing us down instead of helping us move forward. [89]</mark></p>
      <p>I see perseverative thinking as possibly the top issue tripping up my patients. And more often than not, this type of thinking has grooved a deep pattern in their brains to the point that they have identified with their habits: "I am a smoker." "I am anxious”. [90]</p>
      <p>In theory, mindfulness and meditation help us become aware of perseverative thinking. Instead of getting stuck in a groove of repeating the thought pattern, we can see that we are stuck and pull ourselves out of it, creating new and more positive habits along the way. [90]</p>
      <p>People who are depressed perseverate about the past. People who are anxious perseverate about the future. [92]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
      <p>If you are the avoid type, you can pay attention to related behaviors such as being overly judgmental (of yourself and others) or overly focusing on accuracy to the detriment of the bigger picture. [99]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
      <p>One of the worries that often drives procrastination is a fear of failure or inadequacy. [105]</p>
      <p>Habits free up our brain to learn new things. But not every action becomes a habit. Your brain has to choose what to lay down as habit and what not to do again. Remember, you learn a habit based on how rewarding the behavior is. The more rewarding a behavior is, the stronger the habit. [107]</p>
      <p>To change a behavior, you can't just focus on the behavior itself. Instead, you have to address the felt experience of the rewards of that behavior. [109]</p>
      <p>What do I get from this behavior? [114]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
      <p>Simply mapping out habit loops and seeing their lack of value doesn't magically unwind years and years of entrenchment. [121]</p>
      <p>For the deeply entrenched habits, your brain needs to see the lack of reward over and over before the new habit of not doing the old behavior takes hold. [121]</p>
      <p><mark>Old habitual behaviors are based on outdated data, yet because they are old, they are familiar; and because they are familiar, we trust them. [122]</mark></p>
      <p>Map our a habit loop (first gear); ask yourself, What do I get from this? and pay attention to the body sensations, thoughts, and emotions that come as a result of the behavior (second gear). Repeat. [123]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
      <p>What do I get from this? (Ask your self after something has happened). Second gear still works even after the fact. You can learn from the situation while it is happening. [127]</p>
      <p>You learn to see the world in a certain way based on your previous experiences. Each time you do something that reinforces your learning, the lenses of your world-view glasses get a bit thicker, and the fit also gets more comfortable. [130]</p>
      <p>"If parents want to give their children a gift, the best thing they can do is to teach their children to love challenges, be intrigued by mistakes, seek new strategies, enjoy effort, and keep on learning. That way, their children don't have to be slaves of praise. They will have a lifelong way to build and repair their own confidence. [131-132]</p>
      <p>When my students or patients are suffering under the weight of never-ending anxiety, a stubborn habit, or out-of-control addiction, I encourage them to see if they can envision these experiences as teachers. [133]</p>
      <p>All experiences move us forward it we are aware and open to learning from them. [135]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
      <p>Bringing awareness to the results of your behaviors as a way to facilitate habit change goes beyond eating: it may also work with habits like worrying. One example would be planning for the future. Planning is like chocolate-a little tastes good, bur too much of it can be counterproductive, as it can induce anxiety about what can go wrong [139]</p>
      <p><mark>It's important to always be kind to ourselves, rather than beating ourselves up for the way our
        brains are set up. [141]</mark></p>
        <p>When you bring in this curious attitude, they are much less likely to have the power they once had over you. It becomes obvious that they are just thoughts and sensations in your body. [141]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
      <p>If you habitually eat cake without paying attention to the actual outcome-as in, how rewarding IS It right now?--your brain wont signal that anything is amiss or wrong (no prediction error because cake = cake). But if you do pay attention to the actual outcome, and eating two pieces of cake isn't as rewarding as it was when you were five years old and could eat cake for breakfast, lunch, and dinner without gaining weight, this prediction error signals to your brain that it is time to update the reward value. And this is the mathematical basis for second gear. This is how you learn. This is how you change habits. [146]</p>
      <p>Paying attention is really important if you want to change a habit. If it's a habit that you desperately want to break, you can't tell, force, or wish it to stop, because these likely don't have an effect on its reward value. If it's a habit that you want to start in twenty-one days or twenty-one years, the chances of that happening based on reason, force, or wish are pretty slim on the same grounds. [149]</p>
      <p>Don't trust your thoughts (especially the should’s). Thoughts are just mental words and images that come and go and should be viewed with a healthy skepticism. [150]</p>
      <p>Trust your brain. Your brain has evolved over cons to help you survive. Even though it doesn’t have all of the answers and can some times lead you astray (e.g., worry thinking), it won't suddenly switch up the very old tried, true, and trusted mechanisms of how you learn (i.e., reward-based learning) and let you down now. The more you know how it works, and the more you see that mapping out habit loops and becoming disenchanted with old behaviors helps to move you forward, the more this trust will deepen. [151]</p>
      <p>“Forgiveness is giving up hope of a better past [154]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
      <p>Our modern neural networks are still very much in hunter-gatherer (and not be hunted) mode. This means that reward-based learning shows up every time we smoke a cigarette, eat a cupcake, or check our email or news feed when were stressed: basically, each time we reach out for something to soothe ourselves, we reinforce the learning, to the point where it becomes automatic and habitual. [160]</p>
      <p>The primary neural structures that have been shown to be associated with cognitive control (for example, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) are the first structures to go offline when faced with triggers such as stress" [162]</p>
      <p>Awareness is also required in order to affect or change behavior [162]</p>
      <p>In contrast, mindfulness would suggest paying attention: experience the consequences/ results of the behavior and learn for the next time. [163]</p>
      <p>Remember, the survival brain is much stronger than its younger and weaker prefrontal cortical cousin. [163]</p>
      <p>Joy is an expansive feeling, while stress and anxiety are constricted ones. [167]</p>
      <p>Mindful awareness doesn't change the strength of one's desire, nor does it increase the strength of one's willpower. Instead, it modifies the relationship between the two. [167]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
      <p>Curiosity is an innate, natural, and universal capacity that we all share, and it naturally blossoms most fully when we are children. [173]</p>
      <p>Jordan Litman and Paul Silvia itemized two main "favors" of curiosity, which they dubbed I-curiosity and D-curiosity. The I in I-curiosity stands for interest, the pleasurable aspects of the hunger for knowledge, while the D in D-curiosity stands for deprivation, the idea chat if we have a gap in information, we go into a restless, unpleasant, need-to-know state. [174]</p>
      <p>Interest curiosity is piqued when we become interested in learning more about something [176]</p>
      <p>It turns out curiosity builds on (surprise!) reward-based learning. [176]</p>
      <p>The acquisition of information follows the same basic behavioral pathways as reward-based learning and even has a literal reward value in the brain. We can add information to the list with food and water when it comes to survival. [177]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
      <p>Dave's brain couldn't use its reward-based learning processes to rate behaviors as safe or not safe, so it simply assumed nothing was safe (it was safer chat way). He had been walking around on high alert (with high anxiety) for more than three decades. [186-187]</p>
      <p><mark>"Is there danger here now?" [187]</mark></p>
      <p>Importantly, I wasn't trying to convince him that he was safe, nor asking him to convince himself. Instead we were training him to give his brain more accurate information. [187]</p>
      <p>When we move out of our comfort zone, our survival brain starts warning us that we're moving into parts unknown--there could be danger out there. If we see the world as either safe or unsafe, the only options are comfort or danger: wére either in our comfort zone or in the danger zone (which many of my patients call the panic zone, because it feels so uncomfortable that they start panicking). That's how Dave described it to me: not being anxious was making him anxious because it was unfamiliar to him. In other words, the discomfort of being in a new mental space, even if that new place was the garden of calm, was triggering his survival brain to look out for danger. Who knows, calm could be dangerous. [188]</p>
      <p>Whether we are exploring a new idea, an unfamiliar place, or a person we've just met, we can approach new areas with fear or we can employ an attitude of curiosity. [188-189]</p>
      <p>With anything unpleasant (especially anxiety and panic), we tend to run away from it, which then becomes a learned behavior. Yet with curiosity, we can learn to turn toward it, or even lean into unpleasant things. [190]</p>
      <p>The more curious and open to your experiences you are, the greater your reserves of energy to explore. [191]</p>
      <p>Let curiosity naturally move you forward, building your ability to navigate new challenges in the future and saving your strength for when you need it. [191]</p>
      <p>Your breath is actually a great third-gear BBO [193]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. Your breath is always available.</p>
        <p>2. Paying attention to your breath helps you step out of your old habit loop.</p>
        <p>3. Breathing doesn't feed the habit loop process itself.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It was very interesting to feel the heat of a flush rise in my face and feel my stress reaction arising, but then step back from it. I was able to keep quiet for longer, listen better, and notice clearly the stress response happening to the other people in the meeting. [195]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 18</h2>
      <p>The prefrontal cortex can tell the limbic system that knives are dangerous, but the limbic system doesn't respond to reason. It has to feel the pain of the wound to learn its lesson. [199]</p>
      <p>The more you become aware that urges and cravings are just body sensations taking you for a ride, the more you can learn to ride them out. [202]</p>
      <p>If thoughts arise, simply note "thinking" and don't get caught up in analysis or fix-it mode! Note your actual experience. [204]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 19</h2>
      <p>Sit in a comfortable position in a quiet place and let your mind just rest on the feeling of your body breathing. [210]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 20</h2>
      <p>Triggers are the result of us having learned a behavior that we then associate with a stimulus. That trigger can be anything. Seeing something, feeling something, or even having a simple thought can trigger a habitual reaction that then sets a habit loop in motion. Naturally, we think that if we can identify those triggers, we can either avoid them in the future, or better yet, fix them. Thus we’re getting stuck trying to fix the past. But we can't change it- we can only learn from it and change our habitual behaviors in the present, which sets up new habit loops going forward. [218]</p>
      <p>If we take the approach of trying to avoid triggers, not only is it nearly impossible (though it hasn't stopped my patients from trying!), but it doesn't get at the root cause of the problem. [220]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 21</h2>
      <p>The spin and commentary are what turn panic symptoms/attacks into a panic disorder: we start worrying about the next time we will worry; we start getting anxious that we might get anxious. [232-233]</p>
      <p>You build good mindfulness habits through short moments of practice, many times throughout the day. [235]</p>
      <p>This is especially important for habitual self-doubters (and the rest of us) who quickly move on from those rewarding moments. Because of our over-scheduled and hectic lives, when we lack danger at our doorstep, we often quickly move on from the good, so it doesn't register in our brains. In psychology, our tendency to register and continue to ruminate on negative stimuli and events more than positive ones is known as negativity bias (aka positive-negative asymmetry). [236]</p>

      <p>It took me a while, but I figured out that a lot of my stomach pain came from not knowing the subject matter well enough to know what to write [244-245]</p>
      <p>But replication is the hallmark of science. You have to replicate an experiment to see if it is true [248]</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 23</h2>
      <p>Every time we go on social media or news sites that algorithmically use our click preferences to selectively show us items in our feed, we're unknowingly casting our vote for tailored and computer-curated content, which becomes familiar and thus reinforces our preferences for future clicks. The more we click, the more likely we are to develop extreme views, simply because the ambiguity of having to figure something out, or consider a number of facts or opinions feels worse than the in-group feel of a shared view or a single perspective [256-257]</p>
