      <h2>Preface</h2>
      <p>It had also made clear that leadership usually gravitates to the man who can get up and say what he thinks. [p.xiv]</p>
      <p>Our trouble is not ignorance, but inaction. [p.xvii]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>Our main business is not to see what lies dimly at a distance, but to do what lies clearly at hand. [p.3]</p>
      <p><mark>During the Second World War, our military leaders planned for the morrow, but they could not afford to have any anxiety. "I have supplied the best men with the best equipment we have," said Admiral Ernest J. King, who directed the United States Navy, "and have given them what seems to be the wisest mission. That is all i can do. [p.5]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>One of the most appalling comments on our present way of life is that at one time half of all the beds in our hospitals were reserved for patients with nervous and mental troubles, patients who had collapsed under the crushing burden of accumulated yesterdays and fearful tomorrows. [p.8]</mark></p>
      <p>You and I are standing this very second at the meeting place of two eternities: the vast past that has endured forever, and the future that is plunging on to the last syllable of recorded time. [p.8]</p>
      <p>One of the most tragic things I know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living. [p.10]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>I have been using the same anti-worry technique for thirty years. It consists of three steps: [p.15]</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Step l. Analyze the situation fearlessly and honestly and figured out what was the worst that could possibly happen as a result of this failure.</p>
      <p>Step ll. After figuring out what was the worst that could possibly happen, I reconciled myself to accepting it, if necessary.</p>
      <p>Step III. From that time on, I calmly devoted my time and energy to trying to improve upon the worst which I had already accepted mentally.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>When we have accepted the worst, we have nothing more to lose. And that automatically means we have everything to gain! [p.16]</p>
      <p>If you have a worry problem, apply the magic formula of Willis H. Carrier by doing these three things [p.20]</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>1. Ask yourself, "What is the worst that can possibly happen?</p>
      <p>2. Prepare to accept it if you have to.</p>
      <p>3. Then calmly proceed to improve on the worst.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p>"Fear causes worry. Worry makes you tense and nervous and affects the nerves of your stomach and actually changes the gastric juices of your stomach from normal to abnormal and often leads to stomach ulcers." [p.22]</p>
      <p><mark>What shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world-and loses his health? [p.23]</mark></p>
      <p>The best-known cigarette manufacturer in the world dropped dead from heart failure while trying to take a little recreation in the Canadian woods. He amassed millions-and fell dead at sixty-one. He probably traded years of his life for what is called "business success." [p.23]</p>
      <p>Plato said that "the greatest mistake physicians make is that they attempt to cure the body without attempting to cure the mind; yet the mind and body are one and should not be treated separately"! [p.23]</p>
      <p>Heart disease is the number one killer in America today. During the Second World War, almost a third of a million men were killed in combat; but during the same period, heart disease killed two million civilians–and one million of those casualties were caused by the kind of heart disease that is brought on by worry and high-tension living. [p.28]</p>
      <p>"Those who keep the peace of their inner selves in the midst of the tumult of the modern city are immune from nervous diseases. - Dr. Alexis Carrel [p.29]</p>
      <p><mark>"Those who do not know how to fight worry die young.” - Dr. Alexis Carrel [p.30]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      <p>It is the failure to arrive at a fixed purpose, the inability to stop going round and round in maddening circles, that drives men to nervous breakdowns and living hells. [p.40]</p>
      <p>Unless we carry out our action, all our fact-finding and analysis is whistling upwind. [p.40]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      <p>Answer these four questions [p.45-46]</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>1. What is the problem?</p>
      <p>2. What is the cause of the problem?</p>
      <p>3. What are all possible solutions of the problem?</p>
      <p>4. What solution do you suggest?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>"My associates rarely come to me now with their problems. Why? Because they have discovered that in order to answer those four questions they have to get all the facts and think their problems through. [p.46]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
      <p>I realized that it is difficult to worry while you are busy doing some thing that requires planning and thinking. [p.52]</p>
      <p>The great scientist, Pasteur, spoke of the peace that is found in libraries and laboratories." Why is peace found there? Because the men in libraries and laboratories are usually too absorbed in their tasks to worry about themselves. Research men rarely have nervous breakdowns. They haven't time for such luxuries.” [p.53]</p>
      <p><mark>It is utterly impossible for any human mind, no matter how brilliant, to think of more than one thing at any given time. [p.53]</mark></p>
      <p>“Occupational therapy" is the term now used by psychiatry when work is prescribed as though it were a medicine. [p.53]</p>
      <p>Most of us have little trouble "losing ourselves in action" while we have our noses to the grindstone and are doing our day's work. But the hours after work-they are the dangerous ones. [p.54]</p>
      <p><amrk>Worry is a habit. [p.58]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
      <p>I learned more about the art of living in those fifteen terrible hours in that submarine than I had learned by studying books for four years in Syracuse University. [p.61]</p>
      <p>We often face the major disasters of life bravely and then let the trifles, the "pains in the neck," get us down. [p.61]</p>
      <p>After acting as arbiter in more than forty thousand unhappy marriages, declared: "Trivialities are at the bottom of most marital unhappiness" (Judge Joseph Sabath of Chicago). [p.62]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
      <p>According to the law of averages, it is just as dangerous, just as fatal, to try to live from age fifty to age fifty-five in peacetime as it was to fight in the Battle of Gettysburg. [p.68]</p>
      <p>Nearly all of our worries and unhappiness come from our imagination and not from reality. [p.70]</p>
      <p>"What are the chances, according to the law of averages, that this event I am worrying about will ever occur?" [p.72]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
      <p>As you and I march across the decades of time, we are going to meet a lot of unpleasant situations that are so. They cannot be otherwise. We have our choice. We can either accept them as inevitable and adjust ourselves to them, or we can ruin our lives with rebellion and maybe end up with a nervous breakdown. [p.74]</p>
      <p>Circumstances alone do not make us happy or unhappy. It is the way we react to circumstances that determines our feelings. [p.75]</p>
      <p>"It is not miserable to be blind, it is only miserable not to be able to endure blindness." [p.76]</p>
      <p><mark>There is only one way to happiness," Epictetus taught the Romans, "and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will." [p.78]</mark></p>
      <p>No one living has enough emotion and vigor to fight the inevitable and, at the same time, enough left over to create a new life. Choose one or the other. [p.79]</p>
      <p>"Try to bear lightly what needs must be." [p.81]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
      <p><mark>"The cost of a thing is the amount of what I call life, which is required to be exchanged for it immediately or in the long run." - Henry Thoreau [p.84]</mark></p>
      <p>"Let's put a stop-loss order on this thing instantly. We are squandering our lives. [p.87]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
      <p>If you were to read everything that has ever been written about worry by the great scholars of all time, you would never read anything more basic or more profound than such hackneyed proverbs as "Don't cross your bridges until you come to them" and "Don't cry over spilt milk.” [p.91]</p>
      <p>When you start worrying about things that are over and done with, you're merely trying to saw sawdust. [p.92]</p>
      <p><mark>He did it by running the Jack Dempsey Restaurant on Broadway and the Great Northern Hotel on 57th Street. He did it by promoting prize fights and giving boxing exhibitions. He did it by getting so busy on some thing constructive that he had neither the time nor the temptation to worry about the past. [p.93]</mark></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
      <p>Our thoughts make us what we are. Our mental attitude is the X factor that determines our fate. [p.99]</p>
      <p>"A man is what he thinks about all day long." ... How could he possibly be anything else? [p.99]</p>
