      <p>It had also made clear that leadership usually gravitates to the man who can get up and say what he thinks. [p.xiv]</p>
      <p>Our trouble is not ignorance, but inaction. [p.xvii]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>Our main business is not to see what lies dimly at a distance, but to do what lies clearly at hand. [p.3]</p>
      <p><mark>During the Second World War, our military leaders planned for the morrow, but they could not afford to have any anxiety. "I have supplied the best men with the best equipment we have," said Admiral Ernest J. King, who directed the United States Navy, "and have given them what seems to be the wisest mission. That is all i can do. [p.5]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>One of the most appalling comments on our present way of life is that at one time half of all the beds in our hospitals were reserved for patients with nervous and mental troubles, patients who had collapsed under the crushing burden of accumulated yesterdays and fearful tomorrows. [p.8]</mark></p>
      <p>You and I are standing this very second at the meeting place of two eternities: the vast past that has endured forever, and the future that is plunging on to the last syllable of recorded time. [p.8]</p>
      <p>One of the most tragic things I know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living. [p.10]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>I have been using the same anti-worry technique for thirty years. It consists of three steps: [p.15]</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Step l. Analyze the situation fearlessly and honestly and figured out what was the worst that could possibly happen as a result of this failure.</p>
      <p>Step ll. After figuring out what was the worst that could possibly happen, I reconciled myself to accepting it, if necessary.</p>
      <p>Step III. From that time on, I calmly devoted my time and energy to trying to improve upon the worst which I had already accepted mentally.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>When we have accepted the worst, we have nothing more to lose. And that automatically means we have everything to gain! [p.16]</p>
      <p>If you have a worry problem, apply the magic formula of Willis H. Carrier by doing these three things [p.20]</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>1. Ask yourself, "What is the worst that can possibly happen?</p>
      <p>2. Prepare to accept it if you have to.</p>
      <p>3. Then calmly proceed to improve on the worst.</p>

      <p>"Fear causes worry. Worry makes you tense and nervous and affects the nerves of your stomach and actually changes the gastric juices of your stomach from normal to abnormal and often leads to stomach ulcers." [p.22]</p>
      <p><mark>What shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world-and loses his health? [p.23]</mark></p>
      <p>The best-known cigarette manufacturer in the world dropped dead from heart failure while trying to take a little recreation in the Canadian woods. He amassed millions-and fell dead at sixty-one. He probably traded years of his life for what is called "business success." [p.23]</p>
      <p>Plato said that "the greatest mistake physicians make is that they attempt to cure the body without attempting to cure the mind; yet the mind and body are one and should not be treated separately"! [p.23]</p>
      <p>Heart disease is the number one killer in America today. During the Second World War, almost a third of a million men were killed in combat; but during the same period, heart disease killed two million civilians–and one million of those casualties were caused by the kind of heart disease that is brought on by worry and high-tension living. [p.28]</p>
      <p>"Those who keep the peace of their inner selves in the midst of the tumult of the modern city are immune from nervous diseases. - Dr. Alexis Carrel [p.29]</p>
      <p><mark>"Those who do not know how to fight worry die young.” - Dr. Alexis Carrel [p.30]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      <p>It is the failure to arrive at a fixed purpose, the inability to stop going round and round in maddening circles, that drives men to nervous breakdowns and living hells. [p.40]</p>
      <p>Unless we carry out our action, all our fact-finding and analysis is whistling upwind. [p.40]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      <p>Answer these four questions [p.45-46]</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>1. What is the problem?</p>
      <p>2. What is the cause of the problem?</p>
      <p>3. What are all possible solutions of the problem?</p>
      <p>4. What solution do you suggest?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>"My associates rarely come to me now with their problems. Why? Because they have discovered that in order to answer those four questions they have to get all the facts and think their problems through. [p.46]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
      <p>I realized that it is difficult to worry while you are busy doing some thing that requires planning and thinking. [p.52]</p>
      <p>The great scientist, Pasteur, spoke of the peace that is found in libraries and laboratories." Why is peace found there? Because the men in libraries and laboratories are usually too absorbed in their tasks to worry about themselves. Research men rarely have nervous breakdowns. They haven't time for such luxuries.” [p.53]</p>
      <p><mark>It is utterly impossible for any human mind, no matter how brilliant, to think of more than one thing at any given time. [p.53]</mark></p>
      <p>“Occupational therapy" is the term now used by psychiatry when work is prescribed as though it were a medicine. [p.53]</p>
      <p>Most of us have little trouble "losing ourselves in action" while we have our noses to the grindstone and are doing our day's work. But the hours after work-they are the dangerous ones. [p.54]</p>
      <p><amrk>Worry is a habit. [p.58]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
      <p>I learned more about the art of living in those fifteen terrible hours in that submarine than I had learned by studying books for four years in Syracuse University. [p.61]</p>
      <p>We often face the major disasters of life bravely and then let the trifles, the "pains in the neck," get us down. [p.61]</p>
      <p>After acting as arbiter in more than forty thousand unhappy marriages, declared: "Trivialities are at the bottom of most marital unhappiness" (Judge Joseph Sabath of Chicago). [p.62]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
      <p>According to the law of averages, it is just as dangerous, just as fatal, to try to live from age fifty to age fifty-five in peacetime as it was to fight in the Battle of Gettysburg. [p.68]</p>
      <p>Nearly all of our worries and unhappiness come from our imagination and not from reality. [p.70]</p>
      <p>"What are the chances, according to the law of averages, that this event I am worrying about will ever occur?" [p.72]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
      <p>As you and I march across the decades of time, we are going to meet a lot of unpleasant situations that are so. They cannot be otherwise. We have our choice. We can either accept them as inevitable and adjust ourselves to them, or we can ruin our lives with rebellion and maybe end up with a nervous breakdown. [p.74]</p>
      <p>Circumstances alone do not make us happy or unhappy. It is the way we react to circumstances that determines our feelings. [p.75]</p>
      <p>"It is not miserable to be blind, it is only miserable not to be able to endure blindness." [p.76]</p>
      <p><mark>There is only one way to happiness," Epictetus taught the Romans, "and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will." [p.78]</mark></p>
      <p>No one living has enough emotion and vigor to fight the inevitable and, at the same time, enough left over to create a new life. Choose one or the other. [p.79]</p>
      <p>"Try to bear lightly what needs must be." [p.81]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
      <p><mark>"The cost of a thing is the amount of what I call life, which is required to be exchanged for it immediately or in the long run." - Henry Thoreau [p.84]</mark></p>
      <p>"Let's put a stop-loss order on this thing instantly. We are squandering our lives. [p.87]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
      <p>If you were to read everything that has ever been written about worry by the great scholars of all time, you would never read anything more basic or more profound than such hackneyed proverbs as "Don't cross your bridges until you come to them" and "Don't cry over spilt milk.” [p.91]</p>
      <p>When you start worrying about things that are over and done with, you're merely trying to saw sawdust. [p.92]</p>
      <p><mark>He did it by running the Jack Dempsey Restaurant on Broadway and the Great Northern Hotel on 57th Street. He did it by promoting prize fights and giving boxing exhibitions. He did it by getting so busy on some thing constructive that he had neither the time nor the temptation to worry about the past. [p.93]</mark></p>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
      <p>Our thoughts make us what we are. Our mental attitude is the X factor that determines our fate. [p.99]</p>
      <p>"A man is what he thinks about all day long." ... How could he possibly be anything else? [p.99]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
      <p>One sure way to forgive and forget our enemies is to become absorbed in some cause infinitely bigger than ourselves. [p.115]</p>
      <p>“I have no time to quarrel," he said, "no time for regrets, and no man can force me to stoop low enough to hate him. " [p.117]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
      <p><mark>Human nature has always been human nature and it probably won't change in your lifetime. So why not accept it? Why not be as realistic about it as was old Marcus Aurelius, one of the wisest men who ever ruled the Roman Empire. He wrote in his diary one day: "I am going to meet people today who talk too much-people who are selfish, egotistical, ungrateful. But I won't be surprised or disturbed, for I couldn't imagine a world without such people." [p.121]</mark></p>
      <p>What this woman really wants is love and attention. But she calls it "gratitude." And she will never get gratitude or love, because she demands it. [p.121]</p>
      <p><mark>"The ideal man," said Aristotle, "takes joy in doing favors for others," [p.122]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
      <p>I am ashamed to realize that I never really learned to live until I feared I was going to die. [p.129]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
      <p><mark>This problem of being unwilling to be yourself is the hidden spring behind many neuroses and psychoses and complexes. [p.132]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
      <p>"The most important thing in life is not to capitalize on your gains. Any fool can do that. The really important thing is to profit from your losses. That requires intelligence; and it makes the difference between a man of se

        <section>
          <h2>Chapter 18</h2>
          <p>Dr. Loupe had the inner glow of a man with a purpose, a mission. He had the joy of knowing that he was being used by an idea far nobler and more significant than himself. [p.147-148]</p>
          <p>Why will doing a good deed every day produce such astounding effects on the doer? Because trying to please others will cause us to stop thinking of ourselves: the very thing that produces worry and fear and melancholia. [p.150]</p>
          <p>"About one third of my patients are suffering from no clinically definable neurosis, but from the senselessness and emptiness of their lives.” - Carl Jung [p.153]</p>
          <p>"Doing good to others is not a duty. It is a joy, for it increases your own health and happiness.” [p.154]</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Chapter 19</h2>
          <p>I no longer have the faintest interest in the differences in creeds that divide the churches. But I am tremendously interested in what religion does for me. [p.164]</p>
          <p>A little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism; but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion." - Francis Bacon [p.165]</p>
          <p>"Faith is one of the forces by which men live," he declared, "and the total absence of it means collapse. " - William James [p.169]</p>
          <p><mark>"Few men in their lifetime come anywhere near exhausting the resources dwelling within them There are deep wells of strength that are never used.” - Richard Byrd [p.175]</mark></p>

          <h2>Chapter 20</h2>
          <p>When you are kicked and criticized, remember that it is often done because it gives the kicker a feeling of importance. It often means that you are accomplishing something and are worthy of attention. [p.182]</p>
          <p>Vulgar people take huge delight in the faults and follies of great men." [p.182]</p>
          <p><mark>It is almost impossible not to believe what you want to believe. [p.183]</mark></p>

          <h2>Chapter 21</h2>
          <p>People are not thinking about you and me or caring what is said about us. They are thinking about themselves. [p.186]</p>
          <p>I finally discovered that the more I tried to pacify and to smooth over injured feelings in order to escape personal criticism, the more certain I was to increase my enemies. [p.187]</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Chapter 22</h2>
          <p>I ask myself: 'What mistakes did I make that time?" What did I do that was right-and in what way could I have improved my performance?' 'What lessons can I learn from that experience? [p.190]</p>
          <p>"Have you learned lessons only of those who admired you, and were tender with you, and stood aside for you? Have you not learned great lessons from those who rejected you, and braced themselves against you, or disputed the passage with you?" - Walt Whitman [p.191]</p>
          <p><mark>Lincoln welcomed criticism when he knew it was sincere, founded on knowledge, and given in a spirit of helpfulness. [p.191]</mark></p>
          <p><mark>We are not creatures of logic. We are creatures of emotions. Our logic is like a birch-bark canoe tossed about on a deep, dark, stormy sea of emotion. [p.192]</mark></p>

        <section>
          <h2>Chapter 23</h2>
          <p>Fatigue often produces worry, or, at least, it makes you susceptible to worry. [p.197]</p>
          <p><mark>Rest is repair. [p198]</mark></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Chapter 24</h2>
          <p>Most of our fatigue derives from our mental and emotional attitudes. [p.202]</p>
          <p>Boredom, resentment, a feeling of not being appreciated, a feeling of futility, hurry, anxiety, worry-those are the emotional factors that exhaust the sitting worker, make him susceptible to colds, reduce his output, and send him home with a nervous headache. [p.203]</p>
          <p><mark>Millions of people who wouldn't dream of wasting dollars go right on wasting and squandering their energy. [p.203]</mark></p>

        <section>
          <h2>Chapter 26</h2>
          <p>"Men do not die from overwork. They die from dissipation and worry." Yes, from dissipation of their energies—and worry because they never seem to get their work done. [p.214]</p>
          <p>Do Things in the Order of Their Importance. [p.214]</p>
          <p><mark>Many business persons are driving themselves to premature graves because they have never learned to delegate responsibility to others, insisting on doing everything themselves. [p.216]</mark></p>

          <h2>Chapter 27</h2>
          <p>One of the chief causes of fatigue is boredom. [p.217]</p>
          <p><mark>Our fatigue is often caused not by work, but by worry, frustration, and resentment. [p.219]</mark></p>
          <p>"The lucky folks are the ones that get to do things they enjoy doing." Such folk are lucky because they have more energy, more happiness, less worry, and less fatigue. [p.219]</p>
          <p>By talking to yourself about the things you have to be grateful for, you can fill your mind with thoughts that soar and sing. [p.224]</p>
          <p>you spend about one half of your waking hours at your work, and if you don't find happiness in your work, you may never find it anywhere. [p.224]</p>
          <p>Keep reminding yourself that getting interested in your job will take your mind off your worries, and, in the long run, will probably bring promotion and increased pay. Even if it doesn't do that, it will reduce fatigue to a minimum and help you enjoy your hours of leisure. [p.224]</p>

          <h2>Chapter 28</h2>
          <p>Dr. Nathaniel Kleitman, professor at the University of Chicago, had done more research work on sleep than had any other living man. An expert on sleep, he declared that he had never known anyone to die from insomnia. To be sure, a man might worry about insomnia until he lowered his vitality and was swept away by germs. But it was the worry that did the damage, not the insomnia itself. [p.227]</p>
          <p><mark>Talk to your body. According to Dr. Fink, words are the key to all kinds of hypnosis; and when you consis tently can't sleep, it is because you have talked yourself into a case of insomnia. The way to undo this is to dehypnotize your self-and you can do it by saying to the muscles of your body, "Let go, let go-loosen up and relax." [p.228]</mark></p>

          <h2>True stories</h2>
          <p><mark>The more I read, the more sharply I realize that the world has always been in the throes of agony, that civilization has always been tottering on the brink. The pages of history fairly shriek with tragic tales of war, famine, poverty, pestilence, and man's inhumanity to man. [p.238]</mark></p>
          <p>I realize that bad as conditions are now, they are infinitely better than they used to be. [p.238]</p>
          <p>The seven years I spent with the Arabs convinced me that the neurotics, the insane, the drunks of America and Europe are the product of the hurried and harassed lives we live in our so-called civilization. [p.244]</p>
          <p>Avoid the folly of hurry, rush, and working under tension. [p.246]</p>
          <p>"Sometimes when I have too many things to do all at once, I sit down and relax and smoke my pipe for an hour and do nothing." [p.246]</p>
          <p>Break the worry habit: [p.251]</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>1. FIND OUT PRECISELY WHAT IS THE PROBLEM YOU WORRYING ABOUT</p>
          <p>2. FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.</p>
          <p>3. DO SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE AT ONCE ABOUT SOLVING THE PROBLEM.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>I believe it is a good thing to have to endure an agonizing experience occasionally. It is good to know that we have hit bottom and survived. [p.254]</p>
          <p>Military experts say that the first principle of fighting a battle is to keep your line of supplies open. [p.256]</p>
          <p>Another thing I did was to keep reminding myself of the futility of worry. [p.257]</p>
          <p>"What a fool you are to be worrying about something that hasn't happened and may never happen. Life is short. I have only a few years to live, so I must enjoy life." [p.263]</p>
          <p>"See here, Cameron Shipp, you are acting like a fool. You are taking yourself and your little activities much, much too seriously. [p.267]</p>
          <p><mark>"The secret of being miserable is to have the leisure to bother about whether you are happy or not." Keep active, keep busy! [p.270]</mark></p>
          <p>I have found that, if only I have patience, the worry that is trying to harass me will often collapse like a pricked balloon. [p.271]</p>
          <p><mark>Worry is a habit. [p.273]</mark></p>
          <p>I finally made it a rule never to call a player's attention to his mistakes until twenty-four hours after the game. [p.274]</p>
          <p>I soon found that you can catch health, happiness, and success from others just as easily as you can catch worries, bitterness, and failure [p.276]</p>
