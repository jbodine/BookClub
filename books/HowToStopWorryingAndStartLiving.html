      <p>It had also made clear that leadership usually gravitates to the man who can get up and say what he thinks. [p.xiv]</p>
      <p>Our trouble is not ignorance, but inaction. [p.xvii]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>Our main business is not to see what lies dimly at a distance, but to do what lies clearly at hand. [p.3]</p>
      <p><mark>During the Second World War, our military leaders planned for the morrow, but they could not afford to have any anxiety. "I have supplied the best men with the best equipment we have," said Admiral Ernest J. King, who directed the United States Navy, "and have given them what seems to be the wisest mission. That is all i can do. [p.5]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>One of the most appalling comments on our present way of life is that at one time half of all the beds in our hospitals were reserved for patients with nervous and mental troubles, patients who had collapsed under the crushing burden of accumulated yesterdays and fearful tomorrows. [p.8]</mark></p>
      <p>You and I are standing this very second at the meeting place of two eternities: the vast past that has endured forever, and the future that is plunging on to the last syllable of recorded time. [p.8]</p>
      <p>One of the most tragic things I know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living. [p.10]</p>
      <p>I have been using the same anti-worry technique for thirty years. It consists of three steps: [p.15]</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Step l. Analyze the situation fearlessly and honestly and figured out what was the worst that could possibly happen as a result of this failure.</p>
      <p>Step ll. After figuring out what was the worst that could possibly happen, I reconciled myself to accepting it, if necessary.</p>
      <p>Step III. From that time on, I calmly devoted my time and energy to trying to improve upon the worst which I had already accepted mentally.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>When we have accepted the worst, we have nothing more to lose. And that automatically means we have everything to gain! [p.16]</p>
      <p>If you have a worry problem, apply the magic formula of Willis H. Carrier by doing these three things [p.20]</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>1. Ask yourself, "What is the worst that can possibly happen?</p>
      <p>2. Prepare to accept it if you have to.</p>
      <p>3. Then calmly proceed to improve on the worst.</p>
