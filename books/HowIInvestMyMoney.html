      <h2>Introduction (Josh Brown)</h2>
      <p>The reasons why people invest are every bit as important as the names and descriptions of the investments themselves. [3]</p>

        <h2>Morgan Housel </h2>
        <p>The difference between what someone suggests you do and what they do for themselves isn't always a bad thing. It just underscores that when dealing with complicated and emotional issues that affect you and your family, there is no one right answer. There is no universal truth. [8]</p>
        <p>Independence, to me, doesn't mean you'll stop working. It means you only do the work you like with people you like at the times you want for as long as you want. [9]</p>

        <h2>Brian Portnoy</h2>
        <p>Nearly all of us nearly all of the time should own stock and bond beta index funds (or ETFs), allocate to them in reasonable proportions, and then get on with life. [27]</p>
        <p><mark>Times like 2008 put my financial-and family-stability at risk. I need to hedge that. I have had many finance jobs, left some willingly, others not, and cash hedges my liabilities, both cash flow and emotional. [28]</mark></p>
        <p>Unlike others, I've not hopscotched to different banks offering marginally higher rates. The hassle doesn't seem worth a few extra basis points. Instead, Ive tried to park my cash in short-term municipal bond offerings with outsized yields. [28]</p>
        <p>A dear friend started a cool company that provides meditation services to corporate clients. I invested $25,000 because I'm rooting for her. She's killing it but even if it falters, I'll know I supported my friend. Generally, if a few of these [angle and venture investments] hit, I will make "a lot of money. The actual number is a total guess and to peg my financial plan on one would be foolish. These are lottery tickets. [29]</p>
        <p>Money can serve both chaos and control. I know from my day jobs that the control part is elusive, and that playing the odds is about the best we can do. [29]</p>
        <p><mark>Funding contentment, so it seems, is not a "number" to hit or an age to achieve, but an ongoing quest to afford what really matters. [30]</mark></p>

        <h2>Joshua Brown</h2>
        <p>Almost everything I do is with a long-term bias. I don't day trade or swing trade, because I'm bad at it and I feel as though those activities are a full-time commitment. I don't want to commit to any investing style that requires my attention all day long because I'm building and running a company. [33]</p>
        <p><mark>Indeed, the elder Mr. Bogle's stake in his son's mutual fund is one of his few non-index investments. "We do some things for family reasons," he says. "If it's not consistent, well, life isn' always consistent. [35]</mark></p>
        <p>I also own two dozen individual stocks. Mostly companies where I am a fan, user and customer of their products and services. JPMorgan, Slack, Starbucks, Shake Shack, Apple, Amazon, Google, Verizon, Uber, etc. I buy these things and don't sell them. I add to them when opportunities present themselves. I automatically reinvest the dividends. [35]</p>
        <p>I have to balance the need to put money away for my kids when they're older with the desire to do things for them now, like family vacations. We can't do everything, so there are many ongoing conversations about the value of experiences today versus having assets tomorrow. [36]</p>
        <p>Never argue the merits of my own portfolio with anyone else. There will always be people who criticize how others invest and what they invest in, but these arguments are usually coming from a place of insecurity and doubt. If you're confident in what you're doing, then the last thing in the world you're worried about is what other people are doing. [37]</p>

        <p><mark>All the best things in our lives provide benefits that compound. Our financial investments do that, and so do our personal and family investments. [45]</mark></p>

        <h2>Carolyn McChlanahan</h2>
        <p>Taking care of heart attacks and dying people was much less stressful than day trading. [50]</p>
        <p><mark>I learned the most important determinant of financial independence was not how much you save - it is how much you spend. [51]</mark></p>
        <p>We continued to live well and frugally, and to this day, our spending is about what we value in life experience, charity, and convenience. [51]</p>

        <h2>Dasarte Yarnway</h2>
        <p>We were not rich in dollars, but rich in love, experiences and the unwavering belief that all that we had is all that we needed. [61]</p>
        <p>If I value a particular thing, person or place, I want to invest my money there. If I am also spending a significant amount of time on said thing, person or place, I also will consider investing there. [61]</p>
        <p><mark>If you want to judge the character of a man, judge not his words but his actions. [62]</mark></p>

        <h2>Nina O’Neal</h2>
        <p>My financial goals are not built on big returns or grandiose dreams. They anchor on financial stability and living a fulfilling life. [72]</p>
        <p><mark>We have to prepare to live well both in the present and in the future. [72]</mark></p>

        <h2>Debbie Freeman</h2>
        <p>People are the friendliest around breakfast time. [76]</p>
        <p><mark>Having options and a little bit of luck are the key to financial security. [78]</mark></p>

        <h2>Ashby Daniels</h2>
        <p>I believe in keeping things simple and it starts with defining enough. [95]</p>
        <p>Enough is defined internally, not externally. [95]</p>
        <p>It is healthy to have wants that go unfulfilled. [95]</p>
        <p>Once something is good enough, I move on to more pressing issues. [96]</p>
        <p>It is widely accepted that anything that reduces short-term volatility must also reduce long-term return. [97]</p>
        <p>I don’t believe in continuously optimizing our portfolio because one fact most people willingly ignore is that all portfolio optimization is based exclusively on past data. That sounds obvious, but there seems to be a disconnect since our industry focuses so much on this idea. [97]</p>

        <h2>Leighann Miko</h2>
        <p>In 2019 I made mental health a priority so I could give myself the space to move from the person I think I am to the person I actually am. Part of that is absolute brutal honesty with myself, especially as it pertains to my motivations and values. Despite my relative success, there still exists a deep disconnect between where I am and where I think I am in life. [113]</p>
        <p><mark>One thing I never do or recommend anyone do is make a decision based solely on the monetary benefit or consequence. There's another side to the coin that is equally, if not more, important. [114]</mark></p>
        <p>I try to spend my money in ways that have the greatest benefit to the most people. [114]</p>

        <h2>Joshua Rogers</h2>
        <p><mark>Keep wealth circulating by giving and receiving care, value, information, appreciation, and love. [130]</mark></p>
        <p>Be generous, take risks with your investments (you will be rewarded), let other people make money too, invest in people who you like and trust. This kind of approach creates an energy of giving and positivity which results in more circulation, more abundance, and thus abundant investment returns (but also spiritual returns). [130]</p>
        <p><mark>Worry less about the fees involved in investing and more about the taxes. [131]</mark></p>
        <p>Good traders move on quickly and unemotionally from losing investments to get refocused on good investments. [132]</p>
        <p><mark>Recognize that all investing involves risk and therefore means you will lose sometimes. [132]</mark></p>
        <p>He who cares least, wins. [132]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Michael Underhill</h2>
        <p>Inflation of 2% a year for 30 years reduces your purchasing power by 45%. Inflation therefore brings "longevity risk into play for all investors. [143]</p>
        <p>Investors hesitate to diversity and explore products that they are not familiar with, thus limiting their diversification. [144]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Dan Egan</h2>
        <p><mark>Sometimes people become owned by their money and possessions: they spend their lives managing them and taking care of them. Instead of money freeing them from concerns or anxieties, they've architected and decorated their own prison in their wealth and they can't escape for fear of losing it. [154]</mark></p>
        <p><mark>Your money is a wonderful servant and a terrible master. You should only care as much about money as what joy it can bring or pain it can remove. Otherwise, give it as little attention as possible. [154]</mark></p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Howard Lindzon</h2>
        <p>It is hard to be a generalist long term (at least in my opinion) and that ties to our unique network. A bull market will bail out generalists, but recessions, bear markets and illiquidity happen. Having the domain experience to help founders and their teams survive and thrive through a bear market is an edge. [158]</p>

        <h2>Ryan Krueger</h2>
        <p>Sharing money on purpose, to light a curiosity on fire in somebody else who has desire, is my favorite dividend. [167]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion (Brian Portnoy) </h2>
        <p>Money is an expression of our values and our identity. [195]</p>
