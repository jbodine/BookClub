      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The premise of this book is that doing well with money has a little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. [2]</p>
      <p>Ronald Read was patient; Richard Fuscone was greedy. That's all it took to eclipse the massive education and experience gap between the two. [4]</p>
      <p>We think about and are taught about money in ways that are too much like physics (with rules and laws) and not enough like psychology (with emotions and nuance). [6]</p>
      <p>Few topics offer a more powerful magnifying glass that helps explain why people behave the way they do than money. [6]</p>
      <p><mark>Physics isn't controversial. It's guided by laws. Finance is different. It's guided by people's behaviors. [6]</mark></p>
      <p>History never repeats itself; man always does. - Voltaire [7]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>Here's the thing: People from different generations, raised by different parents who earned different incomes and held different values, in different parts of the world, born into different economies, experiencing different job markets with different incentives and different degrees of luck, learn very different lessons. [11]</p>
      <p><mark>Studying history makes you feel like you understand something. But until you've lived through it and personally felt its consequences, you may not understand it enough to change your behavior. [13]</mark></p>
      <p>The entire concept of being entitled to retirement is, at most, two generations old. [20]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>Everything worth pursuing has less than 100% odds of succeeding, and risk is just what happens when you end up on the unfortunate side of that equation. [29]</p>
      <p>Some people are born into families that encourage education; others are against it. Some are born into flourishing economies encouraging of entrepreneurship; others are born into war and destitution. I want you to be successful, and I want you to earn it. But realize that not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when judging people, including yourself. [33]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p>The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving. [41]</p>
      <p>Many will only stop reaching for more when they break and are forced to. [43]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      <p>You don't need tremendous force to create tremendous results. [49]</p>
      <p>His skill is investing, but his secret is time. That's how compounding works. [50]</p>
      <p>We often overlook the key drivers of success. [51]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      <p>Getting money is one thing. Keeping it is another. [59]</p>
      <p>The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans has, on average, roughly 20% turnover per decade for causes that don't have to do with death or transferring money to another family member. [59]</p>
      <p>Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there. But keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. It requires humility, and fear that what you've made can be taken away from you just as fast. It requires frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you've made is attributable to luck, so past success can't be relied upon to repeat indefinitely. [60]</p>
      <p>A plan is only useful if it can survive reality. And a future filled with unknowns is everyone's reality. A good plan doesn't pretend this weren't true; it embraces it and emphasizes room for error. [63]</p>
      <p><mark>Many bets fail not because they were wrong, but because they were mostly right in a situation that required things to be exactly right. Room for error-often called margin of safety—is one of the most under-appreciated forces in finance. [64]</mark></p>
      <p>Sensible optimism is a belief that the odds are in your favor, and over time things will balance out to a good outcome even if what happens in between is filled with misery. [64]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
      <p><mark>The great art dealers operated like index funds. They bought everything they could. And they bought it in portfolios, not individual pieces they happened to like. Then they sat and waited for a few winners to emerge. [72]</mark></p>
      <p>We underestimate how normal it is for a lot of things to fail. Which causes us to overreact when they do. [72]</p>
      <p>Napoleon's definition of a military genius was, "The man who can do the average thing when all those around him are going crazy." It's the same in investing. [76]</p>
      <p>Something I've learned from both investors and entrepreneurs is that no one makes good decisions all the time. The most impressive people are packed full of horrendous ideas that are often acted upon. [78]</p>
      <p>When we pay special attention to a role model's successes we overlook that their gains came from a small percent of their actions. [80]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
      <p>Doing something you love on a schedule you can't control can feel the same as doing something you hate. [85]</p>
      <p>If the operating equipment of the 21st century is a portable device, this means the modern factory is not a place at all. It is the day itself. [88]</p>
      <p>Compared to generations prior, control over your time has diminished. And since controlling your time is such a key happiness influencer, we shouldn't be surprised that people don't feel much happier even though we are, on average, richer than ever. [89]</p>
      <p>Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays. [89]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
      <p>Wealth is financial assets that haven't yet been converted into the stuff you see. [98]</p>
      <p>When most people say they want to be a millionaire, what they might actually mean is "I’d like to spend a million dollars”. [98]</p>
      <p>The problem for many of us is that it is easy to find rich role models. It's harder to find wealthy ones because by definition their success is more hidden. [99]</p>
      <p>It's difficult to learn from what you can't see. [100]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
      <p>Wealth is just the accumulated leftovers after you spend what you take in. And since you can build wealth without a high income, but have no chance of building wealth without a high savings rate, it's clear which one matters more. [105]</p>
      <p>Saving is a hedge against life's inevitable ability to surprise the hell out of you at the worst possible moment. [107]</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
      <p>Do not aim to be coldly rational when making financial decisions. Aim to just be pretty reasonable. Reasonable is more realistic and you have a better chance of sticking with it for the long run, which is what matters most when managing money. [113]</p>
      <p>There are few financial variables more correlated to performance than commitment to a strategy during its lean years. [118]</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
      <p>History is the study of change, ironically used as a map of the future. [121]</p>
      <p>Investors have feelings. Quite a few of them. That's why it's hard to predict what they'll do next based solely on what they did in the past. [124]</p>
      <p>The most important driver of anything tied to money is the stories people tell themselves and the preferences they have for goods and services. Those things don't tend to sit still. They change with culture and generation. They're always changing and always will. [124]</p>
      <p><mark>The thing that makes tail events easy to under-appreciate is how easy it is to underestimate how things compound. How, for example, 9/u prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which helped drive the housing bubble, which led to the financial crisis, which led to a poor jobs market, which led tens of millions to seek a college education, which led to six trillion in student loans with a 10.8% default rate. It's not intuitive to link 19 hijackers to the current weight of student loans, but that's what happens in a world driven by a few outlier tail events. [126]</mark></p>
      <p>Realizing the future might not look anything like the past is a special kind of skill that is not generally looked highly upon by the financial forecasting community. [127]</p>
      <p>The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising. Not that we should use past surprises as a guide to future boundaries; that we should use past surprises as an admission that we have no idea what might happen next. [128]</p>
      <p>The further back in history you look, the more general your takeaways should be. General things like peoples relationship to greed and fear, how they behave under stress, and how they respond to incentives tend to be stable in time. The history of money is useful for that kind of stuff. [133]</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
      <p>You have to give yourself room for error. You have to plan on your plan not going according to plan. [138]</p>
      <p>History is littered with good ideas taken too far, which are indistinguishable from bad ideas. The wisdom in having room for error is acknowledging that uncertainty, randomness, and chance "unknowns"-are an ever-present part of life. [138]</p>
      <p>“The purpose of the margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary." [139]</p>
      <p>Margin of safety—you can also call it room for error or redundancy —is the only effective way to safely navigate a world that is governed by odds, not certainties. And almost everything related to money exists in that kind of world. [139]</p>
      <p>Having a gap between what you can technically endure versus what's emotionally possible is an overlooked version of room for error. [141]</p>
      <p><mark>No risk that can wipe you out is ever worth taking. [142]</mark></p>
      <p>You can plan for every risk except the things that are too crazy to cross your mind. And those crazy things can do the most harm, because they happen more often than you think and you have no plan for how to deal with them. [144]</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
      <p>The first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily. [151]</p>
      <p>Sunk costs-anchoring decisions to past efforts that can't be refunded-are a devil in a world where people change over time. [154]</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
      <p>Every job looks easy when you're not the one doing it because the challenges faced by someone in the arena are often invisible to those in the crowd. [158]</p>
      <p>Like everything else worthwhile, successful investing demands a price. But its currency is not dollars and cents. It's volatility, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and regret—all of which are easy to overlook until you're dealing with them in real time. [158]</p>
      <p>It sounds trivial, but thinking of market volatility as a fee rather than a fine is an important part of developing the kind of mindset that lets you stick around long enough for investing gains to work in your favor. [162]</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
      <p>Blaming bubbles on greed and stopping there misses important lessons about how and why people rationalize what in hindsight look like greedy decisions. [167]</p>
      <p><mark>Investors often innocently take cues from other investors who are playing a different game than they are. [168]</mark></p>
      <p>Many finance and investment decisions are rooted in watching what other people do and either copying them or betting against them. [172]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
      <p>"For reasons I have never understood, people like to hear that the world is going to hell." —Historian Deirdre McCloskey [177]</p>
      <p>Stocks rising 1% might be briefly mentioned in the evening news. But a 1% fall will be reported in bold, all-caps letters usually written in blood red. The asymmetry is hard to avoid. [182]</p>
      <p><mark>There is an iron law in economics: extremely good and extremely bad circumstances rarely stay that way for long because supply and demand adapt in hard-to-predict ways. [183]</mark></p>
      <p>Assuming that something ugly will stay ugly is an easy forecast to make. And it's persuasive, because it doesn't require imagining the world changing. But problems correct and people adapt. Threats incentivize solutions in equal magnitude. That's a common plot of economic history that is too easily forgotten by pessimists who forecast in straight lines. [184]</p>
      <p>Progress happens too slowly to notice, but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore. [184]</p>
      <p>Growth is driven by compounding, which always takes time. Destruction is driven by single points of failure, which can happen in seconds, and loss of confidence, which can happen in an instant. [186]</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 18</h2>
      <p>Stories are, by far, the most powerful force in the economy. [193]</p>
      <p>The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true. [193]</p>
      <p>The bigger the gap between what you want to be true and what you need to be true to have an acceptable outcome, the more you are protecting yourself from falling victim to an appealing financial fiction. [196]</p>
      <p>If you think a recession is coming and you cash out your stocks in anticipation, your view of the economy is suddenly going to be warped by what you want to happen. Every blip, every anecdote, will look like a sign that doom has arrived —maybe not because it has, but because you want it to. [197]</p>
      <p>Everyone has an incomplete view of the world. But we form a complete narrative to fill in the gaps. [197]</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 19</h2>
      <p>You should always measure how you've done by looking at your full portfolio, rather than individual investments. [208]</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 20</h2>
      <p>Good decisions aren't always rational. At some point you have to choose between being happy or being "right”. [217]</p>
      <p>I can afford to not be the greatest investor in the world, but I can't afford to be a bad one. [219]</p>
      <p>One of my deeply held investing beliefs is that there is little correlation between investment effort and investment results. The reason is because the world is driven by tails—a few variables account for the majority of returns. [219]</p>
