      <h2>Preface</h2>
      <p>We live in an extraordinary time, where there could be global prosperity, Perhaps not in the same way we think today, but global prosperity, nonetheless. [p.ix]</p>
      <p>We can not afford to cling to systems and pretend they are working because they did in an era before technology. [p.ix]</p>
      <p>“I am a firm believer that talent is distributed evenly around the world, but opportunities are not.” [p.x]</p>
      <p>The opportunity to create something better comes from observing something broken or that doesn’t work the way you believe it should. [p.xii]</p>
      <p>Sometimes we don’t realize, or we forget, that we control our own thoughts, and we control our time. [p.xii]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>Technology is deflationary [p.1]</p>
      <p>Our economic systems were not built for a world driven by technology where prices keep falling. They were built for a pre-technology era when labour and capital were inextricably linked, an era that counted on growth and inflation, an era where we made money from scarcity and inefficiency. That era is over. [p.2]</p>
      <p><mark>A business is just a collection of people making choices with the aim of growing a better business while, at the same time, in competition with other businesses trying to do the same. [p.2]</mark></p>
      <p>The only thing driving growth in the world today is easy credit, which is being created at a pace that is hard to comprehend. [p.3]</p>
      <p>On our current path, our world will become profoundly more polarized and unsafe. [p.3]</p>
      <p>We are seeing a massive rise in inequality: in the United States, the top 5 percent of the population now holds more than two-thirds of the wealth, while the remaining 95 percent of the population fights for their share of the other third. [p.4]</p>
      <p>When we use technology, there is an exponential effect in its output or power relative to its price. [p.8]</p>
      <p>Deflation, put simply, is when you get more for your money. [p.8]</p>
      <p><mark>Technology is not an industry isolated to our phones or Google searches or things we buy on Amazon. Technology is making its way into everything. It is increasingly the backbone of every industry and every company. In the near feature, if you’re not a technology-based company, you will likely not be a company at all. [p.9]</mark></p>
      <p>There’s just one problem: if technology should be driving everything cheaper, why is life getting more expensive? [p.10]</p>
      <p><mark>This rise in prices is artificial–driven by an enormous rise in credit and debt. [p.11]</mark>
      </p>
      <p><mark>Debt combined with deflation is a toxic combination, because borrowers have to pay the same for their interest payments while earning less. [p.11]</mark></p>
