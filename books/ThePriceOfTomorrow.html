      <h2>Preface</h2>
      <p>We live in an extraordinary time, where there could be global prosperity, Perhaps not in the same way we think today, but global prosperity, nonetheless. [p.ix]</p>
      <p>We can not afford to cling to systems and pretend they are working because they did in an era before technology. [p.ix]</p>
      <p>“I am a firm believer that talent is distributed evenly around the world, but opportunities are not.” [p.x]</p>
      <p>The opportunity to create something better comes from observing something broken or that doesn’t work the way you believe it should. [p.xii]</p>
      <p>Sometimes we don’t realize, or we forget, that we control our own thoughts, and we control our time. [p.xii]</p>
