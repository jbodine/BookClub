      <h2>Preface</h2>
      <p>Scratch golfers don't necessarily hit the largest number of great shots; they hit the fewest really terrible shots. To an extent that may astonish you, exceptional results in equity investing proceed from avoiding a few awful but awfully common-mistakes. [12]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>Wealth is freedom. It isn't a thing, nor is it any accumulation of things. Above all, it isn't a certain number of dollars of net worth. There are, after all, people who would feel themselves inexpressibly wealthy to have accumulated an invested net worth of $500,000 by the time they retire, and others for whom $5 million wouldn't begin to be enough. [16]</p>
      <p>No matter how much money you have, if you're still worried, you aren't wealthy. [16]</p>
      <p>Wealth, you will discover, is much less a function of what you know than of what you do. [18]</p>
      <p>The great bulk of the financial input you get all day is essentially journalistic. And journalism, by its nature, stays in business by selling you the news -which is timely- as opposed to the truth, which is timeless. [24]</p>
      <p>Economic forecasting exists to make astrology look respectable. [35]</p>
      <p>The great advisors deal not in prediction and "performance," but in planning, perspective and behavioral coaching. [35]</p>
      <p><mark>Competence, in an uncertain world, can take you only so far. [38]</mark></p>
      <p>At the end of the day, your coach's advice has to be trusted, even-and especially-when you don't fully understand or agree with it. [41]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>In trying to understand any problem, you're always well advised to break it down into its component parts. By mastering smaller, bite-sized aspects of the problem, you have a better chance to comprehend the whole. [44]</p>
      <p><mark>Certainty is not a condition that exists in nature. [48]</mark></p>
      <p>The farther backward you can look, Winston Churchill said, the farther forward you are likely to see. [48]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p><mark>Volatility isn't risk. [59]</mark></p>
      <p>The great long-term, real-life financial risk isn’t loss of principal, but erosion of purchasing power. [59]</p>
      <p>If you have any goal that will require you to withdraw a large, specific chunk of capital within five years - I recommend taking a pass on equities. [61]</p>
      <p>The total value of the shares of great businesses will go down when the economy contracts. But—and this is critical—it doesn't stay down. [65]</p>
      <p>The advance is permanent; the declines are temporary. [65]</p>
      <p><mark>The issue here is fear: not what the market is doing, but how you are reacting to what the market is doing. [67]</mark></p>
      <p>It is fundamental to human nature that we fear loss much more than we hope for gain. Or, as Richard Thaler, a Nobel laureate in economics, puts it, "Losing money feels twice as bad as making money feels good”. [69]</p>
      <p>Behavioral economists call this phenomenon "asymmetric loss aversion?" Call it what you will, the undeniable fact is that we react disproportionately to falling markets as compared with rising ones. [70]</p>
      <p><mark>People have a hard time making the critical distinction between volatility and loss. To wit, they mistake the former for the latter. [70]</mark></p>
      <p>Fear has a greater grasp on human action than does the impressive weight of historical evidence. [74]</p>
      <p><mark>It is the age-old, never-ending emotional battle between fear of the future and faith in the future. [74]</mark></p>
      <p>Most often the front-line rationalization is current-events-driven. "This cancerous inflation (1979-81), this savage recession (1982), this runaway federal deficit (1984), this insidious Japanese world takeover (1988), this cataclysmic banking crisis and this Gulf war (1990), this terrible recession (1991), this emerging market meltdown (1997-98), these terrorist atrocities (2001), this other Gulf war (2007), this global financial implosion (2008-09), this highly contagious Greece default (2010), this debt ceiling crisis and downgrade of U.S. Treasury bonds (2011), this fiscal cliff (2012), this Ebola pandemic (2014), this Brexit and our own divisive election (2016), this trade war/Fed tightening (2018)... this must surely be the ruin of us all. [77]</p>
      <p>Markets anticipate the economy, and usually change direction well ahead of it. [78]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      <p>Culture-the collection of myths on which we were raised is always far more psychologically powerful than fact. [93]</p>
      <p><mark>In the long run, the only sane definition of "money" is "purchasing power. [96]</mark></p>
      <p>Our predisposition to regard the U.S. greenback as extremely stable ("sound as a dollar"), which it certainly is relative to other currencies. But that's only saying that other world currencies have historically lost purchasing power at a greater rate than ours has. [97]</p>
      <p><mark>If money is purchasing power, "risk is that which threatens purchasing power, and "safety" is that which preserves and enhances purchasing power over time. [97]</mark></p>
      <p>Since bonds and CDs provide a very small return net of inflation (and since even that small margin is all but wiped out by income taxes), it becomes difficult to see how they offer true safety. [97]</p>
      <p>The only thing that should matter to the rational long term investor is total return. [104]</p>
      <p>If you've built in a sufficient margin for error- withdrawing no more than an initial 4.5%-and if you've hedged your bet by squirreling away a couple of years living expenses in a money market fund, so you can shut your equity withdrawals off altogether for a while if the market gets really ugly, the chances are overwhelming that you'll be fine. [106]</p>
      <p>Financial journalism isn't in business to help you become wealthy. It is there to induce you to click on it, so that you'll see the blizzard of advertisements which are journalism's main revenue source. Its product therefore is not wisdom, but clickbait. [107]</p>
      <p><mark>All equity investors—especially those who are retired- should hold meaningful cash reserves. [108]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      <p>Your appropriate behavior with respect to equity investments—and not the relative "performance" of those investments—is the variable that will govern your financial success. [114]</p>
      <p><mark>Most people put huge amounts of energy into variables they can't control, and which won't have much if any real effect on their total lifetime return. [114]</mark></p>
      <p>Your retirement savings plan has to be treated like your most important monthly bill. Because, of course, that's exactly what it is. [120]</p>
      <p>From 1966 to 1982, with dividends reinvested, the S&P 500 only returned something like 5% a year (this was the Viet-nam/Watergate/OPEC/stagflation era, and it featured in 1973-74 the biggest bear market of the postwar period up to that time). A generation later, in 2000-2012, the net return of equities for 13 years was nonexistent other than from dividends. Both these dark periods came after spectacular, multi-year bull markets. The point is that the average 10%- 12% returns (of large- and small-company equities, respectively) are, after all, just that: averages, which means that reality spends about as much time below them as above them. And neither you nor anyone else can time that reality. [121-122]</p>
      <p><mark>Observe that in switching funds, most people are trying to close the performance gap by manipulating a variable they can't control. Typically, they get out of funds that have underperformed in recent years (and may therefore be cyclically about to do very well) and into funds that have shot the lights out in recent years (and may therefore be about to go cold, particularly if they get huge inflows of performance-chasing money that they can't invest well). This may sound like a vicious cycle, but it's actually a downward spiral. [122] </mark></p>
      <p>Concentrating on behavioral responses you can control: increasing your monthly investment, planning to work a year or two longer (even if it's only part-time) and/or trimming your going-in withdrawal rate. [122]</p>
      <p>Bear markets (big sales) can't come along too often, or go down too much. [130]</p>
      <p>You may also be able simply to economize for a while, reducing your annual withdrawal from the "nice to have" down to the "need to have" level. You might even consider taking on some part-time work until the rains come again. I'm not suggesting that these fallback positions are especially pleasant to contemplate; I'm also not saying that they'll ever be necessary. The point is simply that if it starts to feel like your plane is tail-spinning, you don't have to hold the throttle wide open until you hit the ground. You've got options. [134]</p>
      <p><mark>The right time to buy equities is always when you have the money. The right time to sell them is when (and if) you need the money. Otherwise... just let 'em grow. [135]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
      <p>The single greatest lesson, as we’ve seen, is that the world doesn't end, even when it looks like it's about to. [149]</p>
      <p>When enough spaghetti hits the fan all at the same time, everything is correlated. [150]</p>
      <p>The index thesis says that the incremental costs of active management aren't worth it. It holds that the market has become so efficient that active research won't be able consistently to select enough stocks that are so mispriced (relative to the other stocks in the index) that they'll return more than the index plus the incremental management costs. [153]</p>
      <p>Completely understand the most important way not to pick funds: short-term (five years or less) "performance." Chasing recent past "performance" is investing in a rear view mirror, and its as close as you'll ever get to a guarantee of underperformance. [156]</p>
      <p>You should never make an investment decision primarily based on taxes. Second only to short-term performance, taxes are the dumbest single variable you can isolate on. [158]</p>
      <p>Your dollar-cost averaging program will be systematically buying barrelsful of the laggard(s) while reluctantly acquiring thimblesful of whatever's flying. No one ever got wealthy paying top dollar; most seriously monied people got that way buying things that were distressed, out of favor, and therefore on sale. [161]</p>
      <p>You will also help the process along if, once a year on the same day (for the discipline), you rebalance. As some of your funds surge and others languish—which is exactly what diversification is for. [161]</p>
      <p><Mark>All of us would be better investors, said Daniel Kahneman, if we just made fewer decisions. [163]</Mark></p>
      <p>Under diversification—the fatal narrowing of a portfolio down to essentially one idea—pretty much assures that you'll be in the last thing that's "working' just before all the lights go out. In 2000-2002, when the broad market declined almost 50%, NASDAQ's tech-heavy index (the epicenter of the dot.com mania) fell 80%. [166]</p>
      <p>No matter how blue it may be right now, no blue chip is indefinitely exempted from the law of creative destruction. Having a hugely disproportionate percentage of your wealth in one stock isn't even investing any-more: it's more akin to Russian roulette. [167]</p>
      <p>"Investment" has to do with the identification of value. Speculation is almost invariably a bet on the continuation of a price trend. Price and value are always inversely correlated. [170]</p>
