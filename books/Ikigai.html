      <h2>Prologue</h2>
      <p>Japanese concept, which translates roughly as "the happiness of always being busy”. [2]</p>

      <h2>I.</h2>
      <p>One surprising thing you notice, living in Japan, is how active people remain after they retire. In fact, many Japanese people never really retire they keep doing what they love for as long as their health allows. [10]</p>
      <p>Having a purpose in life is so important in Japanese culture that our idea of retirement simply doesn't exist there. [10]</p>
      <p>Their blood tests reveal fewer free radicals (which are responsible for cellular aging), as a result of drinking tea and eating until their stomachs are only 80 percent full. [11]</p>
      <p>The keys to longevity are diet, exercise, finding a purpose in life (an Ikigai), and forming strong social ties- that is, having a broad circle of friends and good family relations. Members of these communities manage their time well in order to reduce stress, consume little meat or processed foods, and drink alcohol in moderation. [14]</p>

      <h2>II.</h2>
      <p>Just as a lack of physical exercise has negative effects on our bodies and mood, a lack of mental exercise is bad for us because it causes our neurons and neural connections to deteriorate-and, as a result, reduces our ability to react to our surroundings. [20]</p>
      <p>Our neurons start to age while we are still in our twenties. This process is slowed, however, by intellectual activity, curiosity, and a desire to learn. [22]</p>
      <p><mark>Dealing with new situations, learning something new every day, playing games, and interacting with other people seem to be essential anti-aging strategies for the mind. [22]</mark></p>
      <p>The body wears down much faster during periods of crisis. [22]</p>
      <p>Be conscious of your daily routine in order to detect harmful habits and replace them with more positive ones. [29]</p>
      <p>The secret to keeping the body young is keeping the mind active [31]</p>
      <p>We happily enjoy all the seasons. [33]</p>

      <h2>III.</h2>
      <p>Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way. [38]</p>
      <p>Frankl believed that our health depends on that natural tension that comes from comparing what we've accomplished so far with what we'd like to achieve in the future. What we need, then, is not a peaceful existence, but a challenge we can strive to meet by applying all the skills at our disposal. [40]</p>
      <p>Existential crisis, on the other hand, is typical of modern societies in which people do what they are told to do, or what others do, rather than what they want to do. [41]</p>
      <p>Humor can help break negative cycles and reduce anxiety. [42]</p>
      <p>We all have the capacity to do noble or terrible things. The side of the equation we end up on depends on our decisions, not on the condition in which we find our-selves. [42]</p>
      <p>The prisoners with the greatest chance of survival were those who had things they wanted to accomplish outside the camp, those who felt a strong need to get out of there alive. [42-43]</p>
      <p>In the West, we tend to believe that what we think influences how we feel, which in turn influences how we act. In contrast, Morita therapy focuses on teaching patients to accept their emotions without trying to control them, since their feelings will change as a result of their actions. [46]</p>
      <p>A donkey that is tied to a post by a rope will keep walking around the post in an attempt to free itself, only to become more immobilized and attached to the post. The same thing applies to people with obsessive thinking who become more trapped in their own suffering when they try to escape from their fears and discomfort. [47]</p>
      <p>Accept your feelings. If we have obsessive thoughts, we should not try to control them or get rid of them. If we do, they become more intense. [47]</p>
      <p>If we try to get rid of one wave with another, we end up with an infinite sea. [47]</p>
      <p><mark>Likened emotions to the weather We can't predict or control them; we can only observe them. [47-48]</mark></p>
      <p>What have I received from person X? What have I given to person X? What problems have I caused person X? Through these reflections, we stop identifying others as the cause of our problems and deepen our own sense of responsibility. [50]</p>

      <h2>IV.</h2>
      <p>Schaffer's model encourages us to take on tasks that we have a chance of completing but that are slightly outside our comfort zone. [58]</p>
      <p>To be able to concentrate for a considerable amount of time is essential to difficult achievement. [59]</p>
      <p>The number one complaint of employees at multinational corporations is that they don't communicate the team's mission clearly, and that, as a result, the employees don't know what their objectives are. [61]</p>
      <p>What often happens, especially in big companies, is that the executives get lost in the details of obsessive planning, creating strategies to hide the fact that they don't have a clear objective. [61]</p>
      <p><mark>It's like heading out to sea with a map but no destination. [61]</mark></p>
      <p>Compass over maps. [61]</p>
      <p>A detailed map may lead you deep into the woods at an unnecessarily high cost. A good compass, though, will always take you where you need to go. [61]</p>
      <p>Our brains can take in millions of bits of information but can only actually process a few dozen per second. [64]</p>
      <p><mark>Concentrating on one thing at a time may be the single most important factor in achieving flow. [64]</mark></p>
      <p>If we continually ask our brains to switch back and forth between tasks, we waste time, make more mistakes, and remember less of what we've done. [65]</p>
      <p>If were not truly being challenged, we get bored and add a layer of complexity to amuse ourselves. [81]</p>
      <p><mark>Our ability to turn routine tasks into moments of micro flow, into something we enjoy, is key to our being happy, since we all have to do such tasks. [81]</mark></p>
      <p>Feynman showed up on his first day of work and said, "OK, boss, what's my assignment?" They didn't have anything prepared, so they asked him to work on a certain mathematical problem. He immediately realized they were giving him an irrelevant task to keep him busy and said, "That sounds like a bunch of baloney- give me something real to do." So they sent him to a nearby shop to buy office supplies, and he completed his assignment with a smile on his face. When he didn't have something important to do or needed to rest his mind, Feynman dedicated himself to micro-flowing say, painting the office walls. Weeks later, after visiting the Thinking Machines offices a group of investors declared, "You have a Nobel laureate in there painting walls and soldering circuits." [82]</p>
      <p>When doing business in Japan, process, manners, and how you work on something is more important than the final results. [85]</p>

      <p>“Your mind and your body. You keep both busy," he said on his 112th birthday, "you'll be here a long time." Back then, he was still exercising every day. Among Breuning's other secrets: He had a habit of helping others, and he wasn't afraid of dying. [93]</p>
      <p>If you want to stay busy even when there's no need to work, there has to be an Ikigai on your horizon, a purpose that guides you throughout your life and pushes you to make things of beauty and utility for the community and yourself. [99]</p>

      <p>The secret is smiling and having a good time. [106]</p>
      <p>The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for. [111]</p>
      <p>One hundred percent of the people we interviewed keep a vegetable garden, and most of them also have fields of tea, mangoes, shikuwasa, and so on. [117]</p>
      <p>They are always busy, but they occupy themselves with tasks that allow them to relax. [118]</p>

      <p>Low caloric intake is common among the five Blue Zones. [124]</p>
      <p>A concept known in Japanese as “hara hachi bu”. It's easy to do: When you notice you're almost full but could have a little more ... just stop eating! [125]</p>
      <p>Food isn't served as appetizers, main courses, and dessert. Instead, it's much more common to see everything presented at once on small plates: one with rice, another with vegetables, a bowl of miso soup, and something to snack on. Serving food on many small plates makes it easier to avoid eating too much, and facilitates the varied diet. [125]</p>
      <p>Avoiding those that add to our overall caloric intake but offer little to no nutritional value. [126]</p>
      <p>Among its many benefits, fasting helps cleanse the digestive system and allows it to rest. [127]</p>

      <h2>VIII.</h2>
      <p>The people who live longest are not the ones who do the most exercise but rather the ones who move the most. [135] </p>
      <p>Yoga-originally from India, though very popular in Japan - and China's qigong and tai chi, among other disciplines, seek to create harmony between a person's body and mind so they can face the world with strength, joy, and serenity. [136]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>IX.</h2>
      <p>One thing that everyone with a clearly defined Ikigai has in common is that they pursue their passion no matter what. They never give up, even when the cards seem stacked against them or they face one hurdle after another. [165] </p>
      <p>Sooner or later, we all have to face difficult moments, and the way we do this can make a huge difference to our quality of life. [165] </p>
      <p>A wise person can live with these pleasures but should always remain conscious of how easy it is to be enslaved by them. [167]</p>
      <p><mark>Stoicism, which centers on the idea that there is nothing wrong with enjoying life's pleasures as long as they do not take control of your life as you enjoy them. You have to be prepared for those pleasures to disappear. [167]</mark></p>
      <p>People can be insatiable. [168]</p>
      <p>Japanese architecture, on the other hand, doesn't try to be imposing or perfect, because it is built in the spirit of wabi-sabi. The tradition of making structures out of wood presupposes their impermanence and the need for future generations to rebuild them. Japanese culture accepts the fleeting nature of the human being and everything we create. [173]</p>
      <p>Avoid spending time doing things we don't enjoy, simply because we feel obligated to do them. [178]</p>
      <p>To build resilience into our lives, we shouldn't fear adversity, because each setback is an opportunity for growth. [179]</p>
      <p>Taking a hit or two can be viewed as either a misfortune or an experience that we can apply to all areas of our lives, as we continually make corrections and set new and better goals. [179]</p>
      <p>We need randomness, mess, adventures, uncertainty, self-discovery, hear traumatic episodes, all these things that make life worth living. [179]</p>

      <h2>Epilogue</h2>
      <p>Modern life estranges us more and more from our true nature, making it very easy for us to lead lives lacking in meaning. Powerful forces and incentives (money, power, attention, success) distract us on a daily basis; don't let them take over your life. Our intuition and curiosity are very powerful internal compasses to help us connect with our Ikigai. Follow those things you enjoy, and get away from or change those you dislike. [183]</p>
      <p><mark>Life is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love you. [183]</mark></p>
      <p>Stay active; don't retire. Those who give up the things they love doing and do well lose their purpose in life. That's why it's so important to keep doing things of value, making progress, bringing beauty or utility to others, helping out, and shaping the world around you, even after your "official" professional activity has ended. [184]</p>
      <p>Take it slow. Being in a hurry is inversely proportional to quality of life. As the old saying goes, "Walk slowly and you'll go far." When we leave urgency behind, life and time take on new meaning. [184]</p>
      <p>Water moves; it is at its best when it flows fresh and doesn't stagnate. The body you move through life in needs a bit of daily maintenance to keep it running for a long time. Plus, exercise releases hormones that make us feel happy. [184]</p>
      <p>Though most people live in cities these days, human beings are made to be part of the natural world. We should return to it often to recharge our batteries. [185]</p>
