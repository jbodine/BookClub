      <h1>The 80/20 Principle</h1>
      <summary>Written by Richard Koch</summary>

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>We tend to expect that all causes will have roughly the same significance. That all customers are equally valuable. [p.10]</p>
      <p>We tend to assume that 50 percent of causes or inputs will account for 50 percent of results or outputs. There seems to be a natural expectation that causes and results are generally equally balanced, but this “50/50 fallacy” is one of our most inaccurate and yet deeply rooted mental maps. [p.10]</p>
      <p>Most of the time, we do not realize the extent to which some resources, but only a small minority, are super-productive — the vital few vs. the trivial many. [p.12]</p>
      <p>The universe is not a straight line [p.14] </p>
      <p>The 80/20 principle, like chaos theory, is based around the idea of non linearity. [p.14]</p>
      <p>Small initial influences can become greatly multiplied and produce highly unexpected results.[p.15]</p>
      <p>A small lead early on can turn into a larger lead or a dominate position later on, until equilibrium is distributed and another small force then exerts a disproportionate influence.[p.16]</P>
      <p><mark>(One of the messages of chaos theory is that equality ends in dominance.) A 51/49 split is inherently unstable and tends to gravitate towards a 95/5, 99/1, or even 100/0 split.</mark> [p.17]</p>
      <p>At any point, a majority of any phenomenon will be explained or caused by a minority of the actors participating in the phenomenon) [p.17]</p>
      <p>The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man - George Bernard Shaw [p.19]</p>
      <p>The few things that work fantastically well should be identified, cultivated, nurtured, and multiplied. [p.20]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>Typically, causes, inputs, or effort divide into two categories: one; the majority, that has little impact or two; a small minority, that has a major, dominant impact. [p.21]</p>
      <p>Nearly always, a small proportion of total products produces a large proportion of profits [p.24]</p>
      <p>Sometimes, 80 percent of the profits come from 30 percent of the products; sometimes it's from 15 percent or even 10 percent. The numbers compared do not have to add up 100, but the picture usually looks unbalanced. [p.24]</p>
      <p>Who you work for is more important than what you do [p.26]</p>
      <p>Long-term client relationships create trust and raise the cost to the client of switching to another consulting firm. Long-term clients tend to not be as price sensitive. [p.26]</p>
      <p>The 20 percent of the most important issues are not necessarily the most interesting ones. [p.?]</p>
      <p>Effort and reward are at best loosely linked. [p.27]</p>
      <p>Wealth from investment can dwarf wealth from working. [p.28]</p>
      <p>The conventional wisdom is not to put all your eggs in one basket. 80/20 wisdom is to choose a basket carefully, load all your eggs into it, and then watch it like a hawk. [p.28]</p>
      <p>Bar charts show the 80/20 relationship best. [p.33]</p>
      <p>The 80/20 analysis is generally used to change the relationship it describes, or to make better use of it (i.e. key causes, the inputs that lead to the outputs, etc). [p.34]</p>
      <p><mark>A firm that finds 80 percent of its profits come from 20 percent of its customers should use this information to concentrate on keeping that 20 percent happy and increasing the business carried out with them. This is much easier, as well as more rewarding than paying equal attention to the whole customer group.</mark> [p.35]</p>
      <p>80/20 analysis can also be misunderstood, misapplied, and instead of being the means to an unusual insight, serve as the justification for conventional thuggery. [p.36]</p>
      <p>The most valuable insight from 80/20 analysis will always come from examining nonlinear relationships that others are neglecting. [p.37]</p>
      <p>80/20 thinking starts with a hypothesis about a possible imbalance between inputs and outputs, but instead of collecting data and analyzing them, we estimate them. [p.38]</p>
      <p>Never assume that we automatically know what the answer is, instead ask: what are the vital few inputs or causes, as opposed to the trivial many. [p.38]</p>
      <p><mark>Calm down, work less and target a limited number of very valuable goals where the 80/20 principle will work for us, rather than pursuing every available opportunity.</mark> [p.39]</p>

      <p>Software (WordPerfect) First, they identify what customers want most of the time and how they want to do it—the old 80/20 rule (people use 20 percent of a program's functions 80 percent of the time). Good software developers make high-use functions as simple and automatic and inevitable as possible. [p.49]</p>
      <p><mark>It is only outside the business where there are results, opportunities, and threats.</mark> [p.50]</p>
      <p>The 80/20 Principle applied to business has one key theme – to generate the most money with the least expenditure of assets and effort. [p.51]</p>
      <p>A product has to be only 10 percent better value than that of a competing product to generate a sales difference of 50 percent and a profit difference of 100 percent. [p.54]</p>
      <p>Major alterations in a business system can flow from apparently insignificant causes. At any one time, people of equal intelligence, skill, and dedication can produce quite unequal results, as a result of a small structural differences. Events cannot be predicted, although predictable patterns tend to recur. [p.55]</p>
      <p>If you can identify where your firm is getting back more than it is putting in, you can up the stakes and make a killing. Similarly, if you can work out where your firm is getting back much less than it is investing, you can cut your losses. [p.56]</p>
      <p>The "where" can be anything. It can be a product, a market, a customer or type of customer, a technology, a channel or distribution, a department or division, a country, a type of transaction or an employee, type of employee or team. [p.56]</p>
      <p>What we are generally allowed to see in business if the net effect of what happens, which is by no means the whole picture. [p.57]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      <p><mark>It is almost inevitable that you are doing too many things for too many people.</mark> [p.58]</p>
      <p>Some customers pay high prices but have a high cost to serve: these are often smaller customers. The very big customers may be easy to deal with and take large volumes of the same product, but screw you down on price. Sometimes these differences balance out, but often they do not. [p.62]</p>
      <p>New clients who do not turn into long-serving clients were recognized as being lost makers, leading to a much more selective approach to pitching for businesses. [p.66]</p>
      <p>The best way to examine the profitability of your business is to break it down into competitive segments. [p.68]</p>
      <p>A competitive segment is a part of your business where you face a different competitor or different competitive Dynamics. [p.69]</p>
      <p>Do you face a different main competitor in this part of your business compared to the rest of it? [p.69]</p>
      <p>If you are up against a specialist competitor, your profitability will depend on the interaction of your product and service against theirs. Which do consumers prefer? And what is your total cost to deliver the product or service relative to your competitors? Your profitability will be as much determined by your competitors as by anything else. [p.69]</p>
      <p>Thinking about competitive segments lobs you straight at the most important way to split and think about your business. [p.70]</p>
      <p>Before reaching final decisions on any segment, however, the instrumentation group's top management examined the two other questions, besides probability, that are key to strategy: [p.75]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>• Is the segment and attractive market to be in?</p>
        <p>• How well is the firm position in each segment?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>A "scale player" operates at a minimum size necessary to be profitable as soon as possible. [p.77]</p>
      <p>80/20 analysis of profits does not give us all the right answers. The analysis is bound to be a snapshot at a point in time and cannot (to start with) provide a picture of the trend or of forces that could change profitability. [p.78]</p>
      <p>The best way to start making money is to stop losing money. [p.78]</p>
      <p>For the full answer, you must look at segments market attractiveness and it how well the firm is positioned in each segment. [p.78]</p>
      <p>80 percent of the profits made in any industry are made by 20 percent of firms. If you aren’t one of these, what are they doing right that you're not? [p.80]</p>
      <p><mark>Where might less be better? [p.80]</mark></p>
      <p>Many consumers would buy a stripped-down, very cheap product. Is anyone providing it in your industry? [p.80]</p>
      <p>Most people prefer humans, but machines are more reliable and much cheaper. [p.81]</p>
      <p>The 80/20 Principle suggests that your strategy is wrong. If you make most of your money out of a small part of your activity, you should turn your company upside down and concentrate your efforts on multiplying this small part. [p.82]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      <p>Nearly everything we make is much more complex than it needs to be. Our clothing, our food, our household furnishings—all could be much simpler than they now are and at the same time be better-looking. [p.83]</p>
      <p>Few people stop to ask why the unprofitable business is so bad. Even fewer stop to think whether you could in practice, as well as in theory, have a business solely composed of the most profitable chunks and get rid of 80 percent of the overhead.[p.84]</p>
      <p><mark>Simple is beautiful. Business people seem to love complexity.</mark> [p.85]</p>
      <p>The act of making a business more complex depresses returns more effectively than any other means known to humanity. [p.85]</p>
      <p>The problem is not extra scale, but extra complexity. Additional scale, without additional complexity, will always give lower unit costs. [p.87]</p>
      <p>When new business is different from existing business, even if it is only slightly different, costs tend to go up. [p.87]</p>
      <p>Small is beautiful. All other things being equal, big is beautiful. But all other things are not equal. [p.88]</p>
      <p>Only one characteristic differentiated the winners from the less successful firms: simplicity. [p.89]</p>
      <p>Parts of the business that are mature and simple can be amazingly profitable. Cutting the number of products, customers, and suppliers usually leads to higher profits, partly because you can have the luxury of just focusing on the most profitable activities and customers, but partly also because the costs of complexity. [p.89]</p>
      <p>The best approach is to decide is the part of the value-adding chain (R&D/manufacturing/distribution/selling/marketing/servicing) where your company has the greatest comparative advantage—and then ruthlessly outsource everything else. [p.90]</p>
      <p>The key problem with head offices is not their cost; it is the way they take away real responsibility and initiative from those who do the work and add the value to customers. [p.90]</p>
      <p>Corporations can center themselves around customer needs rather than around the management. [p.90]</p>
      <p>Executives are often staggered to learn that the most neglected areas are the most profitable. It is no accident. (And one of the unfortunate products of 80/20 Analysis is sometimes that the most profitable areas get a lot more attention from managers at the top. As a result, they can begin to drop down the profitability league table). [p.90]</p>
      <p>For customers, the quest for self-importance is at least as important as the quest for value. [p.90]</p>
      <p>Simplicity raises prices as well lowering costs. [p.90]</p>
      <p>If you focus on the most profitable segments, you can grow them surprisingly fast—nearly always at 20 percent a year sometimes even faster. [p.91]</p>
      <p>Often the most profitable, is to harvest these segments [less profitable], deliberately losing market share. You let go of the less profitable customers and products, cut off most support and sales effort, raise prices, and allow sales to decline at 5-20 percent while you laugh all the way to the bank. [p.91]</p>
      <p>What is most simple and standardized is hugely more productive and cost-effective than what is complex. [p.91]</p>
      <p><mark>The simplest messages are the most appealing and universal.</mark> [p.91]</p>
      <p>Letting the customer access your business system—as with all forms of self-service-creates choice, economy, speed, and spend. [p.92]</p>
      <p>Make the simplest 20 percent as high quality and consistent as imaginable. [p.92]</p>
      <p>The 50/5 Principle asserts that, typically, 50 percent of a company’s customers, products, components, and suppliers will add less than 5 percent to revenues and profits. Getting rid of the low-volume (and negative value) 50 percent of items is the key to reducing complexity. [p.93]</p>
      <p>The road to hell is paved with the pursuit of volume. Volume leads to marginal products, marginal customers, and greatly increased managerial complexity. [p.93]</p>
      <p>All organizations, especially large and complex ones, are inherently inefficient and wasteful. They do not focus on what they should be doing. They should be adding value to their customers and potential customers. Any activity that does not fulfill this goal is unproductive. [p.94]</p>
      <p>Waste thrives on complexity; effectiveness requires simplicity. [p.95]</p>
      <p>All effective techniques to reduce costs use three 80/20 insights: simplification, through elimination of unprofitable activity; focus, on a few key drivers of improvements; and comparison of performance. The last two deserve elaboration. [p.95-96]</p>
      <p>Be selective. Do not tackle everything with equal effort. Cost reduction is an expensive business! [p.96]</p>
      <p>Remember above all that equal cost does not lead to equal customer satisfaction. [p.96]</p>
      <p>Sometimes it is more useful to draw an 80/20 Chart on the basis of the financial impact of the problem (or opportunity) rather than the number of causes. [p.98]</p>
      <p>The 80/20 Principle states that there always are a few high-productivity areas and many low-productivity ones. [p.98]</p>
      <p>Great leaps forward require measurement and comparison of the value delivered to customers and what they will pay for it. [p.99]</p>
      <p><mark>The way to create something great is to create something simple.</mark> [p.99]</p>
      <p>Anyone who is serious about delivering better value to customers can easily do so, by reducing complexity. [p.99]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
      <p>It is absolutely right to be marketing led and customer centered. But it can also (be dangerous). If the product range is extended into too many new areas, or if the obsession with customers leads to recruiting more and more marginal customers, unit costs will rise and returns fall. [p.103]</p>
      <p>The vast majority of firms’ costs lie outside the factory. These costs can be penal if the product range is too large. [p.103]</p>
      <p><mark>You will only be successful in marketing if what you are marketing is different and, for your target customers, either unobtainable elsewhere, or provided by you in a product/service/price package that is much better value than is obtainable elsewhere.</mark> [p.104]</p>
      <p>You can not innovate without a new product or service [p.104]</p>
      <p>Note that there are always apparently good reasons trotted out as to why you need the unprofitable 80 percent of products, in this case the fear of “losing stature” by having a smaller product line. Excuses like this rest on the strange view that shoppers like to see a lot of products they have no intention of buying. [p.104-105]</p>
      <p>In 99 percent of cases is that delisting marginal products boosts profits while not harming customer perceptions one iota. [p.105]</p>
      <p><mark>He told them to pull up their socks and mange their point-of-sales displays properly. This didn’t work. Instead he should have concentrated on the best 20 percent of car washes. What are they doing right? Could they do more of it? What did they have in common? [p.105]</mark></p>
      <p>Focus on the few best products is much less important than focusing on the few best customers. [p.105]</p>
      <p>Keep in closest contact with the 20 percent of your clients who give you 80 percent of your business. [p.106] </p>
      <p>The core customer group that matters: those that consume heavily and frequently. [p.106]</p>
      <p>The real key is to provide surprising service, above and beyond the call of duty and quite out of line with prevailing industry standards. This may have a short-term cost but it will have a long-term reward. [p.107]</p>
      <p>If the core customers are happy, the long-term expansion of the business is assured. [p.108]</p>
      <p>The key to superior sales performance is to stop thinking averages and start thinking 80/20. Average sales performance is very misleading. [p.109]</p>
      <p><mark>One obvious but often neglected imperative is the hang on to the high performers. You shouldn’t follow the old adage: if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. If it ain’t broke, make damn sure it doesn’t break. The next best thing to staying close to your customers is to stay close to the top salespeople. Keep them happy; this cannon be done solely with cash. [p.110]</mark></p>
      <p>Put your sales superstars in a room together and work out what they have in common Better still, ask then to help you hire more people like them. [p.110]</p>
      <p>Try to identify when the top salespeople sell the most and what they did differently then. [p.110]</p>
      <p>Get everyone to adopt methods that have the highest ratio of output to input. [p.110]</p>
      <p>Switch a successful team for one area with an unsuccessful team from another area. Do this as a genuine experiment: you will soon find out wether the good team can beat the structural difficulties or vice versa. [p.110]</p>
      <p><mark>The sales force should be rewarded for selling the most profitable products, not the least profitable. [p.112]</mark></p>
      <p>Teach the salesforce to rank their customers by sales and profits. [p.112]</p>
      <p><mark>If opportunities to sell more existing products have been exhausted, the salesforce should concentrate on providing superior service, so that existing business will be protected and identifying new products that the core customers want. [p.112]</mark></p>
      <p>Finally, get the salesforce to revisit old customers who have provided good business in the past. This can mean knocking on old doors or calling old phone numbers. This is an amazingly successful sales technique, amazingly neglected. [p.113]</p>
      <p>Some customers are vital. Most are not. [p.114]</p>

      <p>The vital few and the trivial many: only a few things that ever produce important results. [p.117]</p>
      <p>All you need to know is whether something is working or not and change the mix until it is; then keep the mix constant until it stops working. [p.117]</p>

      <p>Accounting systems are the enemy of fair rewards, because they are absolutely brilliant at obscuring where the money is really being made. This is why, human frailty apart, the imbalance between performance and reward is greater in large and complex firms than in small businesses. [p.129]</p>
      <p>Personal, corporate, and national success resides not in invention, or even in creating the marketable innovation, but in spotting the point at which the innovation is about to become irresistible and then riding it for all it is worth. [p.131]</p>
      <p>Change is necessary for survival. Constructive change requires insight into what is most effective and a focus on that winning way. [p.131]</p>
      <p>We usually only notice some thing after it has already become big, when the growth is already decelerating. Fortunes are made by the very few who latch on to growth when it is still small and accelerating. [p.131]</p>
      <p>Whenever you can, move resources from 80 percent activities to 20 percent activities. The profit from this is enormous because it is highly leveraged arbitrage. You use what is not very valuable to make something that is enormously valuable. [p.133]</p>

      <p>The key question is whether there is a major imbalance between the time spent on the one hand and achievement or happiness on the other. [p.149]</p>
      <p>Time management also advocates the establishment of clear priorities, to escape the tyranny of daily events that, although very urgent, may not be all that important. [p.150]</p>
      <p>Society is divided into those who have money enjoy it and those who have time but no money. [p.150]</p>
      <p>Our current use of time is not rational. There is therefore no point in seeking marginal improvements in how we spend our time. [p.151]</p>
      <p>It is our use of time, and not time itself, that is the enemy. [p.151]</p>
      <p><mark>The most productive time on a project is usually the last 20 percent, simply because the work has to be completed before a deadline. Productivity on most projects could be doubled simply by halving the amount of time for their completion. [p.151]</mark></p>
      <p>We do not exist just in the present: we spring from the past and have a treasure trove of past associations; and our future, like our past, is already immanent in the present. [p.152]</p>
      <p>Hard work leads to low returns. Insight and doing what we ourselves want lead to high returns. [p.153]</p>
      <p>Everyone has their own natural balance, rhythm, and optimal work/play mix and most people can sense innately when they are being too lazy or industrious. [p.156]</p>
      <p>The point of examining the common characteristics of your happiness and achievement islands is to isolate something far more basic than what has happened: to isolate what you are uniquely programmed to do best. [p.159]</p>
      <p>For the 80 percent of activities that give you only 20 percent of results, the ideal is to eliminate them. [p.160]</p>

      <p>You can only spend time on high-value activities (whether for achievement or enjoyment) if you have abandoned low-value activities. [p.163]</p>

      <p>Things that matter most Must never be at the mercy of things that matter least. - JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE [p.166]</p>
      <p>It is often easier to make an enthusiasm into a career than to become enthusiastic about a career dictated by others. [p.169]</p>
      <p>Once in your profession, if making money is really important to you and if you are any good at what you do, you should aim to become self-employed as soon as possible and, after that, to start to employ others. [p.173]</p>
      <p>All those nasty fables about Midas and the like a rooted in truth. Money can buy you happiness, but only to the extent that you use money to do what is really right for you in the first place. [p.174]</p>
      <p>You can end up with an expensive life style that controls you rather than vice versa. You might get much better value and happiness out of a simpler and cheaper lifestyle. [p.174]</p>
      <p>It is important to focus on what you find easy. [p.176]</p>
      <p>The 80/20 Principle is clear. Pursue those few things where you are amazingly better than others and that you enjoy most. [p.176]</p>

      <p>A small number of relationships will account for a large proportion of emotional value. Fill your relationship slots with extreme care and not too early! [p.180]</p>
      <p>Nothing is more important than your choice of alliances and how you build them. Without them you are nothing. With them, you can transform your life, often the lives of those around you. and occasionally, in small or large ways, the course of history. [p.180]</p>
      <p>The individual is nothing except as part of a class, certainly; but equally, the individual allied with other individuals of the same class (or possibly, with individuals from another class) is everything. [p.181]</p>
      <p>You don't need many allies but you need the right ones, with the right relationships between you and each of them and between themselves. You need them at the right time, in the right place and with a common interest in advancing your interests. Above all, the allies must trust you and you must be able to trust them. [p.181]</p>
      <p>People help you because there is a strong relationship between you. The best relationships are built on five attributes: mutual enjoyment of each other's company, respect, shared experience, reciprocity, and trust. [p.183]</p>
      <p>If you are in a difficult job, develop one ally whom you like and respect. Make it a deep and fruitful alliance. If you don't, you are missing a big opportunity! [p.185]</p>
      <p><mark>Even if all the other ingredients—friendship, respect, shared experience, and trust-are present, people very often neglect to be proactive in helping their allies. [p.185]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>There is a limited number of slots for relationships; don't use up the slots too early or on low-quality relationships. Choose with care. Then build with commitment. [p.186]</mark></p>
      <p>Mentors must be rewarded or else they will lose interest. The mentee must provide fresh ideas, mental stimulation, enthusiasm, hard work, knowledge of new technologies, or some other attribute of value to the mentor. [p.186-187]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
      <p>There are only four types of officer. First, there are the lazy, stupid ones. Leave them alone, they do no harm... Second, there are the hard-working intelligent ones. They make excellent staff officers, ensuring that every detail is properly considered. Third, there are the hard-working, stupid ones. These people are a menace and must be fired at once. They create irrelevant work for everybody. Finally, there are the intelligent lazy ones. They are suited for the highest office. - GENERAL VON MANSTEIN on the German Officer Corps [p.189]</p>
      <p>For the individual, too, it is better to know a few things well, or preferably one thing exceptionally well, than it is to know many things superficially. [p.196]</p>
      <p><mark>You will not become an acknowledged leader in anything that cannot command your enthusiasm and passion. [p.198]</mark></p>
      <p>Do not expect to become a leader unless you really are more knowledgeable than anyone else. [p.199]</p>
      <p>Your core customer or customers are the specific individuals or corporations that may place the highest value on your activity. [p.199]</p>
      <p>Whether you are employed, self-employed, a small or large employer, or even the head of state, you have core customers on whom your continued success depends. This is true whatever the level of your past achievement. [p.199]</p>
      <p>Keep reminding yourself of some of the golden 80/20 insights. In any sphere of activity, 80 percent of people are only achieving 20 percent of results; and 20 percent of people are achieving 80 percent of results. What are the majority doing wrong and the minority doing right? Come to that, who are the minority? Could you do what they do? Could you take what they do and do it in an even more extreme form? Could you invent an even more clever and efficient way to do it? [p.200]</p>
      <p><mark>Think, think, think. The answer is there somewhere. All you have to do is find it. But don't ask the industry Establishment what the answer is, don't do a survey of your colleagues, and don't try to find the answer in print. All you will find is the conventional wisdom, repeated a zillion ways. The answer will lie with the industry heretics, the professional mavericks, and the eccentric individuals. [p.201] </mark></p>
      <p>Those who are be in any sphere do not think and act in similar ways to the average performers. The leaders may not be conscious of what they do differently. Very rarely do they think about it and articulate it. But, if leaders do not generally explain the secrets of their sucess, these can often be deduced by observation. [p202]</p>
      <p>Be willing to pay a high price to work for the best. [p202]</p>
      <p>Observe, learn, and practice. [p.202]</p>
      <p>Do not worry overmuch about security (become self-employed). Your professional expertise and use of 80/20 precepts constitute your security. In any case, firms can no longer deliver security. [p.203]</p>
      <p>The only constraints are your ability to find employees who add surplus value and your ability (and theirs) to find customers. The latter constraint should not normally operate in the absence of the for mer, since professionals who add excess value should normally find a ready market for their services. [p.204]</p>
      <p><mark>It is crucial to hire only net value creators: those whose value comfortably exceeds their cost. But it would be wrong to say you should only hire the best. [p.204]</mark></p>
      <p>The most successful professional firms and corporations are those that outsource everything but what they are best at. [p.205]</p>

      <p>The P/E of a share is its price divided by its after-tax earnings. [p.213]</p>
      <p>Do not invest heavily when the market is this high [p.213]</p>
      <p>If any share falls by 15 percent (of the price you paid), sell it. Follow this rule rigorously and consistently. The key point about the 15 percent rule has to do with individual stocks, not with the market. [p.213]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
      <p>Spend more time on the type of activities that are very effective at making you happy and less time on other activities. Start by cutting off the "valleys of unhappiness," the things that tend to make you actively unhappy. [p.221]</p>
      <p>Emotional intelligence is more crucial for happiness than intellectual intelligence, yet our society places little emphasis on the development of emotional intelligence. [p.225]</p>
      <p><mark>Even though a high IQ is no guarantee of prosperity, prestige, or happiness in life. our schools and our culture fixate on academic abilities, ignoring emotional intelligence, a set of traits—some might call it character. [p.225]</mark></p>
      <p>Maximizing the proportion of your life under your own control requires planning and often risk taking. The happiness dividends, however, should not be underestimated. [p.232]</p>
      <p>We are likely to achieve most when we have reasonably challenging but not too difficult goals. [p.232]</p>
      <p><mark>If there is a trade-off between achievement and happiness, choose happiness. [p.233]</mark></p>
      <p>We should accept what we cannot control with grace and maturity and get on with molding what we can control. On no account should we let life's objections ruffle us or make us angry, self doubting, or bitter. P.233]</p>

      <p>I was a principal, there were so many things that the teachers could do much better than me, I delegated to them the 80 percent of tasks that I wasn't good at. [p.240]</p>
      <p>Good poker players fold a lot. As Larry W. Phillips writes in Zen and the Art of Poker, "Play only the best 15 to 20 percent of your hands and throw in the rest." [p.242]</p>
      <p>Provided we have food and shelter, what really matters is loving and being loved, self-expression, personal achievement and relaxation, the ability to think and create, the chance to connect with nature and other people-above all, enhancing the lives of the friends and family we truly care about. [p.249]</p>
      <p>Focus on what enhances our life needs to be long-term and intelligent. Skills and re relationships require investment. [p.?]</p>
