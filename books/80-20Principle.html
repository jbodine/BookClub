      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>We tend to expect that all causes will have roughly the same significance. That all customers are equally valuable. [p.10]</p>
      <p>We tend to assume to 50 percent of causes or inputs will account for 50 percent of results or outputs. There seems to be a natural expectation that causes and results are generally equally balanced, but this “50/50 fallacy” is one of our most inaccurate and yet deeply rooted mental maps. [p.10]</p>
      <p>Most of the time, we do not realize the extent to which some resources, but only a small minority, are super-productive — the vital few vs. the trivial many. [p.12]</p>
      <p>The universe is not a straight line – the 80/20 principle, like chaos theory, is based around the idea of non linearity. [p.14]</p>
      <blockquote>
          <p>• A small initial influence can become greatly multiplied and produce highly unexpected results, which nevertheless can be explained in retrospect.[p.?]</p>
          <p>• A small lead early on can turn into a larger lead or a dominate position later on, until equilibrium is distributed and another small force then exerts a disproportionate influence.</P>
          <p>• At any point, a majority of any phenomenon will be explained or caused by a minority of the actors participating in the phenomenon) [p.?]</p>
