      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>There can’t be a teacher without students or a coach without players. [xi-xii]</p>
      <p>I don’t instruct golfers on their swings. I teach them how to use their minds on the golf course and how to play from their hearts. [xv]</p>
      <p>Zen means “action with awareness” being completely in the present moment. [xi]</p>
      <p><mark>In the last twenty years, golf equipment such as clubs, balls and training aids, including the use of video for swing analysis, have improved tremendously. Swing instruction books and magazines are more plentiful now than ever. Still, no appreciable improvement in the average golfer’s scores has resulted. Why? [xvi]</mark></p>
      <p>In the Buddhist tradition there is a saying that for an activity to be fruitful, it must be good in the beginning, in the middle, and good at the end. [xvii]</p>
      <p>The keys to preparation are clarity, commitment, and composure. [xvii]</p>
      <p><mark>The best response to results is one that enhances future performance. [xviii]</mark></p>
      <p>Focus, calmness and confidence, the most essential ingredients of peak performance. [xviii]</p>
      <p>The hopes and fears that create mental obstacles intensifies as we get closer to our objective. [xix]</p>
