      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Trying to learn from customer conversations is like excavating a delicate archeological site. The truth is down there somewhere, but it’s fragile. [p.v]</p>
      <p>Bad customer conversations aren’t just useless. Worse they convince you that you’re on the right path. [p.vi]</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>The measure of usefulness of an early customer conversation is whether it gives us concrete facts about our customers’ lives and world views. [p.5]</p>
      <p>The mom test: [p.7]</p>
      <blockquote>
          <p>• Talk about their life instead of your idea</p>
          <p>• Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future.</P>
          <p>• Talk less and listen more</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Only the market can tell you if your idea is good. Everything else is just opinion. [p.8]</p>
      <p>Ask them to show you how they currently do it . Talk about which parts they love and hate. Ask which other tools and processes they tried before settling on this one. [p.8]</p>
      <p>Ask how they currently solve X and how much it costs them to do so. And how much time it takes. Ask them to talk you through the last time X came up . [p.9]</p>
      <p><mark>People will lie to you if they think it’s what you want to hear. [p.10]</mark></p>
      <p>You don’t want to just collect feature request. You aren’t building the product by committee. But the motivations and constraints behind those requests are critical. [p.10]</p>
      <p>A question like “why do you bother” points towards their motivation. It gives you the why. [p.10]</p>
      <p><mark>Rule of thumb: Some problems don’t actually matter [p.11]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>Whenever possible, you want to be shown, not told by your customers. [p.11]</mark></p>
      <p>If you ran a burger joint, it would be stupid to survey your customers about wether they prefer cheeseburgers or hamburgers. Just watch what they buy (but if you’re trying to understand why they prefer one over the other, you’ll have to talk to them. [p.11] </p>
      <p>Rule of thumb: Watching someone do a task will show you where the problems and inefficiencies really are, not where the customer thinks they are. [p.12]</p>
      <p>Rule of thumb: If they haven’t looked for ways of solving it already, they are not going to look for (or buy) yours. [p.13]</p>
      <p>Common wisdom is that you price your product in terms of value to the customer rather than cost to you. And you can’t quantify the value received without prodding their financial worldview. [p.13]</p>
      <p>Rule of thumb: People stop lying when you ask them for money. [p.13]</p>
      <p>Rule of thumb: While it’s rare that someone will tell you precisely what they’ll pay you, they’ll often show you what it’s worth to them. [p.14]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>There are three types of bad data: [p.17]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>• Compliments</p>
	      <p>• Fluff (generics, hypotheticals, and the future)</p>
	      <p>• Ideas</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Most of your meetings will end with a compliment. It feels good. They said they liked it! Unfortunately, they’re almost certainly lying. [p.18]</p>
      <p>You don’t need to end up with what you wanted to hear in order to have a good conversation. You just need to get to the truth. [p.21]</p>
      <p><mark>Ignoring compliments should be easy, but it’s not. We crave validation and, as such are often tricked into registering compliments as reliable data.</mark> [p.22]</p>
      <p>Fluff comes in three cuddly shapes [p.23]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>• Generic claims (“I usually”, “I always”, “I never”)</p>
	      <p>• Future-tense promises (“I would”, “I will”)</p>
	      <p>• Hypothetical maybes (“I might”, “I could”)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The worst type of fluff-inducing question you can ask is, “Would you ever?”. [p.23]</p>
      <p><mark>When you hear a request it’s your job to understand the motivations behind it.</mark>[p.32]</p>
      <p><mark>Just like feature requests, a strong emotion is worth exploring.</mark> [p.32]</p>
      <p>Questions to dig into emotional signals [p.33]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>• “Tell me more about that”</p>
	      <p>• Why haven’t you been able to fix this already?”</p>
	      <p>• You seem pretty excited about that – it’s a big deal</p>
	      <p>• Go on</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Ideas and feature requests should be understood, not obeyed. [p.33]</p>
      <p>To deal with the “pathos problem” (accidentally fishing for complements), keep the conversation focused on the other person and ask about specific, concrete cases and examples. Once someone detects that your ego is on the line, they’ll give you fluffy mis-truths and extra compliments. [p.34]</p>
      <p>In short remember that compliments are worthless and peoples approval doesn’t make your business better. Keep your idea and your ego out of the conversation until you’re ready to ask for commitments. [p.35]</p>
      <p>Once you start talking about your idea, they stop talking about their problems. [p.36]</p>
