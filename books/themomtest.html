      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Trying to learn from customer conversations is like excavating a delicate archeological site. The truth is down there somewhere, but it’s fragile. [v]</p>
      <p><mark>Bad customer conversations aren’t just useless. Worse they convince you that you’re on the right path. [vi]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>The measure of usefulness of an early customer conversation is whether it gives us concrete facts about our customers’ lives and world views. [5]</p>
      <p>The mom test: [7]</p>
      <blockquote>
          <p>• Talk about their life instead of your idea</p>
          <p>• Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future.</P>
          <p>• Talk less and listen more</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><mark>Only the market can tell you if your idea is good. Everything else is just opinion. [8]</mark></p>
      <p>Ask them to show you how they currently do it . Talk about which parts they love and hate. Ask which other tools and processes they tried before settling on this one. [8]</p>
      <p>Ask how they currently solve X and how much it costs them to do so. And how much time it takes. Ask them to talk you through the last time X came up . [9]</p>
      <p><mark>People will lie to you if they think it’s what you want to hear. [10]</mark></p>
      <p>You don’t want to just collect feature request. You aren’t building the product by committee. But the motivations and constraints behind those requests are critical. [10]</p>
      <p>A question like “why do you bother” points towards their motivation. It gives you the why. [10]</p>
      <p><mark>Rule of thumb: Some problems don’t actually matter [11]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>Whenever possible, you want to be shown, not told by your customers. [11]</mark></p>
      <p>If you ran a burger joint, it would be stupid to survey your customers about wether they prefer cheeseburgers or hamburgers. Just watch what they buy (but if you’re trying to understand why they prefer one over the other, you’ll have to talk to them. [11] </p>
      <p>Rule of thumb: Watching someone do a task will show you where the problems and inefficiencies really are, not where the customer thinks they are. [12]</p>
      <p>Rule of thumb: If they haven’t looked for ways of solving it already, they are not going to look for (or buy) yours. [13]</p>
      <p>Common wisdom is that you price your product in terms of value to the customer rather than cost to you. And you can’t quantify the value received without prodding their financial worldview. [13]</p>
      <p>Rule of thumb: People stop lying when you ask them for money. [13]</p>
      <p>Rule of thumb: While it’s rare that someone will tell you precisely what they’ll pay you, they’ll often show you what it’s worth to them. [14]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>There are three types of bad data: [17]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>• Compliments</p>
	      <p>• Fluff (generics, hypotheticals, and the future)</p>
	      <p>• Ideas</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Most of your meetings will end with a compliment. It feels good. They said they liked it! Unfortunately, they’re almost certainly lying. [18]</p>
      <p>You don’t need to end up with what you wanted to hear in order to have a good conversation. You just need to get to the truth. [21]</p>
      <p><mark>Ignoring compliments should be easy, but it’s not. We crave validation and, as such are often tricked into registering compliments as reliable data. [22]</mark></p>
      <p>Fluff comes in three cuddly shapes [23]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>• Generic claims (“I usually”, “I always”, “I never”)</p>
	      <p>• Future-tense promises (“I would”, “I will”)</p>
	      <p>• Hypothetical maybes (“I might”, “I could”)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The worst type of fluff-inducing question you can ask is, “Would you ever?”. [23]</p>
      <p><mark>When you hear a request it’s your job to understand the motivations behind it. [32]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>Just like feature requests, a strong emotion is worth exploring. [32]</mark></p>
      <p>Questions to dig into emotional signals [33]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>• “Tell me more about that”</p>
	      <p>• Why haven’t you been able to fix this already?”</p>
	      <p>• You seem pretty excited about that – it’s a big deal</p>
	      <p>• Go on</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Ideas and feature requests should be understood, not obeyed. [33]</p>
      <p>To deal with the “pathos problem” (accidentally fishing for complements), keep the conversation focused on the other person and ask about specific, concrete cases and examples. Once someone detects that your ego is on the line, they’ll give you fluffy mis-truths and extra compliments. [34]</p>
      <p>In short remember that compliments are worthless and peoples approval doesn’t make your business better. Keep your idea and your ego out of the conversation until you’re ready to ask for commitments. [35]</p>
      <p>Once you start talking about your idea, they stop talking about their problems. [36]</p>
      <p>Image that the company has failed and ask why that has happened. Then image it as a huge success and ask what had to be true to get there. Find ways to learn about those critical pieces. [39]</p>
      <p><mark>One of the reasons we avoid important questions is because asking them is scary. It can bring us to the unsettling realization that our beloved idea is fundamentally flawed. [40]</mark></p>
      <p><mark> "We go through the futile process of asking for opinions and fishing for compliments because we crave approval. We want to believe that the support and sign off of someone we respect means our venture will succeed. But really, that person's opinion doesn't matter. They have no idea if the business is going to work. Only the market knows. [41]</mark></p>
      <p>You're not here to collect compliments; you're trying to learn the truth. Their lukewarm response already gave you that. [42]</p>
      <p>There's more reliable information in a "meh" than a "Wow!" You can't build a business on a lukewarm response. [42]</p>
      <p>The premature zoom is a real problem because it leads to data which seems like validation, but is actually worthless. [46]</p>
      <p>It doesn't hurt to ask leading questions when you're about to abort the conversation anyway. If they come back with a positive, just be a little extra careful in making sure they aren't lying. [47]</p>
      <p>You can waste a ton of time figuring out the minutia of a trivial problem. Even if you learn everything there is to know about that particular problem, you still haven't got a business. [50]</p>
      <p>Sometimes we comfort ourselves by asking questions which don't actually de-risk the business or resolve those critical, big, scary, lurking questions. We ignore the elephant in the room. [51]</p>
      <p> Product risk: can I build it? Can I grow it? Customer/market risk: do they want it? Will they pay mer Are there lots of them? [54] </p>
      <p>Pre-plan the 3 most important things you want to learn from any given type of person [55]</p>
      <p>Pre-planning your big questions makes it a lot easier to ask questions which pass The Mom Test and aren't biasing. [55]</p>
      <p>When we go through an unplanned conversation, we tend to focus on trivial stuff that keeps the conversation comfortable. Instead, decide on the tough questions in a calm environment with your team. [55]</p>
      <p>You might get answers 1-3 from customer A, answer 4 from customer B, answers 57 from customer C. There's overlap and repetition, but you don't need to repeat the full set of questions with every participant. [56]</p>
      <p>Your time is valuable; don't feel obliged to repeat questions you already have solid data on. [56]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      <p>Steve Blank's original book on Customer Development, 4 Steps to the Epiphany, he solves this by recommending 3 separate meetings: the first about the customer and their problem; the second about your solution; and the third to sell a product. By splitting the meetings, you avoid the premature zoom and Pathos Problem. [57]</p>
      <p>When you strip all the formality from the process, you end up with no meetings, no "interviews", and a much easier time all around. [58]</p>
      <p><mark>The structure of separate problem solution/sales conversations is critical for avoiding bias, but it's important to realize that the first one doesn't actually need to be a meeting. It works better as a chat. [58]</mark></p>
      <p>The Meeting Anti-Pattern is the tendency to relegate every opportunity for customer conversation into a calendar block. [59]</p>
      <p><mark>Being too formal is a crutch we use to deal with an admittedly ambiguous and awkward situation. [60]</mark></p>
      <p>Rule of thumb: Give as little information as possible about your idea while still nudging the discussion in a useful direction. [63]</p>
      <p><mark>Once we've learned the key facts about our industry and customers, it’s time to zoom in again and started revealing our idea and showing some product. The bad news is that this invites nefarious compliments. The good news is that since we have the beginnings of a product, we're now in a position to cut through the false positives by asking for commitments.[65]</mark></p>
      <p>In sales, moving the relationship to the next stage is called "advancement". [65]</p>
      <p>When you fail to push for advancement, you end up with zombie leads: potential customers (or investors) who keep taking meetings and saying nice things, but who never seem to cut a check. [65]</p>
      <p>Rule of thumb: "Customers" who keep being friendly but aren't ever going to buy are a particularly dangerous source of mixed signals. [67]</p>
      <p><mark>It took me years to learn that there's no such thing as a meeting which just "went well". Every meeting either succeeds or fails. [67]</mark></p>
      <p>If you leave with worthless wishy washiness, I'd bet you're falling for one or both) of the following traps: [67]</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>1. You're asking for their opinion about your idea (e.g. fishing for compliments)</p>
      <p>You're not asking for a clear commitment or next steps</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The real failure is listed above as #2: not even asking. I never consider rejection to be a real failure. But not asking certainly is. [67]</p>
      <p>Rule of thumb: If you don't know what happens next after a product or sales meeting, the meeting was pointless. [68]</p>
      <p>Commitment can be cash, but doesn't have to be. [68]</p>
      <p>The major currencies are time, reputation risk, and cash. [68]</p>
      <p>Strong commitments will often combine multiple currencies. [69]</p>
      <p>"Looks great. Let me know when it launches.” Bad meeting. A compliment plus a stalling tactic is the classic way to end a pitch for something you're never going to buy. [70]</p>
      <p>The big error you can make here is to mistake this compliment-stall for a pre-order ("He said he'll buy it when it launches!"). To fix it, look for a commitment you can ask for today. [70]</p>
      <p>The worst meetings are the wishy-washy ones that you leave with neither rejection nor advancement. [73]</p>
      <p><mark>lost meeting can often be saved by just pushing for a commitment at the end while you're being brushed off with a compliment. [74]</mark></p>
      <p>It's not a real lead until you've given them a concrete chance to reject you. [74]</p>
      <p><mark>Pitching gives binary feedback: you either nailed it or you didn’t. That's okay when you're making fine adjustments (tweak this feature) but bad for bigger questions (does anybody care at all about what I'm doing). [75]</mark></p>
      <p>It's pretty weird that anybody buys anything from young startups. In all likelihood, before the year is up, you're going to esthetician go out of business, abandon the product, or sell the company. [75]</p>
      <p>First customers are crazy. Crazy in a good way. They really, really want what you're making. They want it so badly that they're willing to be the crazy person who tries it first.[75]</p>
      <p>Keep an eye out for the people who get emotional about what you're doing There is a significant difference between: "Yeah, that's a problem" and "THAT IS THE WORST PART OF MY LIFE AND I WILL PAY YOU RIGHT NOW TO FIX IT. [75]</p>
      <p>In early stage sales, the real goal is learning. Revenue is a side-effect. [76]</p>
      <p>The only thing people love talking about more than themselves is their problems. [78]</p>
      <p>Joel Gascogne did a classic landing page test with his startup Buffer, describing the value proposition and collecting emails. But contrary to popular understanding, it wasn't the metrics or conversion rate which convinced him to move forward. Instead, it was the conversations which resulted from him emailing every single person who signed up and saying hello. [80]</p>
      <p>Warm intros are the goal. Conversations are infinitely easier when you get an intro through a mutual friend that establishes your credibility and reason for being there. [83]</p>
      <p>Once the meeting starts, you have to grab the reins or it's liable to turn into them drilling you on your idea, which is exactly what you don't want (since that forces you into a pitching situation, thus destroying you’re learning). [89]</p>
      <p>If you're banging your head against the wall trying to get people to answer your cold emails, then you're probably taking the hard road. Spend your energy finding clever ways to generate warm intros instead. [90]</p>
      <p>Willpower is a finite resource. The way to overcome difficult situations isn't to power through, but rather to change your circumstances to require less willpower. [91]</p>
      <p>Every meeting has an opportunity cost. When you’re traveling to that meeting, you aren't writing code or generating leads. [92]</p>
      <p><mark>Keep talking to people until you stop hearing new information. [92]</mark></p>
      <p>If you've run more than 10 conversations and are still getting results that are all over the map, then it's possible that your customer segment is too vague, which means your mashing together feedback from multiple different types of customers. [92-93]</p>
      <p>It's not about “how many” meetings. It's about having enough for you to really understand your customers You want to talk to them enough that you know them in the same way you know your close friends, with a firm grip on their goals, their frustrations, what else they've tried, and how they currently deal with it. [93]</p>
      <p><mark>They say that startups don't starve, they drown. You never have too few options, too few leads, or too few ideas; you have too many. You get overwhelmed. You do a little bit of everything. When it comes to getting above water and making faster progress, good customer segmentation is your best friend. [95]</mark></p>
      <p>When you have a fuzzy sense of who you're serving, you end up talking to a multiple customer segments all at once, which leads to confusing signals and three problems:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. You get overwhelmed by options and don't know where to start</p>
        <p>2. You aren't moving forward but cant prove yourself wrong</P>
        <p>3. You receive mixed feedback and can't make sense of it</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Before we can serve everyone, we have to serve someone. Forgetting about all the possibilities and focusing on who would most likely buy, [96]</p>
      <p><mark>If you aren't finding consistent problems and goals, you don't have a specific enough customer segment. [100]</mark></p>
      <p>If you're facing a generic or varied set of customer segments, you can use Customer Slicing to pick a concrete starting point: Start with any segment and then keep slicing off better and better sub sets of it until you've got a tangible sense to who you can go talk to and where you can find them. [100]</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Start with a broad segment and ask:</p>
      <p>• Within this group, which type of person would want it most?</p>
      <p>• Would everyone within this group buy/use it, or only some?</p>
      <p>• Why does that sub-set want it? (e.g. what is their specific problem)</p>
      <p>• Does everyone in the group have that motivation or only some?</p>
      <p>• What additional motivations are there?</p>
      <p>• Which other types of people have these motivations?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>it's worth choosing customers you admire and enjoy being around. This stuff is hard work and can be a real grind if you're cynical about the people or the industry you're trying to understand and serve. [102]</p>
      <p>Good customer segments are a who-where pair. If you don't know where to go to find your customers, keep slicing your segment into smaller pieces until you do. [102]</p>
      <p><mark>Don't fall into the trap of only talking to the most senior or important people you can find. You want to talk to people who are representative of your customers. [103]</mark></p>
      <p>A common anti-pattern is for the business guy to go to all the meetings and subsequently tell the rest of the team what they should do. Bad idea. Telling the rest of the team "What I learned" is functionally equivalent to telling them "What you'll do. [105]</p>
      <p>Avoiding bottlenecks has three parts: prepping, reviewing, and taking good notes. [106]</p>
      <p><mark>Spend up to an hour writing down your best guesses about what the person you're about to talk to cares about and wants. You'll probably be wrong, but it's easier to keep the discussion on track and hire important points if you've created a skeleton. [107]</mark></p>
      <p> If you don't know what you're trying to learn, you shouldn't bother having the conversation. [108]</p>
      <p><mark>Any strong emotion is worth writing down. [111]</mark></p>
      <p>[Document] Feature request or purchasing criteria, Money or budgets or purchasing process, Mentioned a specific person or company, Follow-up task [112]</p>
      <p>Regardless of the medium, the most important thing is that the notes are lightweight enough that you'll actually review them yourself and with your team. [114]</p>
      <p>Warning signs that you're just going through the motions: [115]</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>• You're talking more than they are</p>
      <p>• They are complimenting you or your idea</p>
      <p>• You told them about your idea and don't have next steps</p>
      <p>• You don't have notes</p>
      <p>• You haven't looked through your notes with your team</p>
      <p>• You got an unexpected answer and it didn't change your idea</p>
      <p>• You weren't scared of any of the questions you asked</p>
      <p>• You aren't sure what you're trying to learn in this conversation</p>
      </blockquote>    
      <p>I still ask dumb questions all the time. You will too. Don't beat yourself up over it. [119]</p>
      <p>Key skills:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>• Asking good questions (Chapters 1 & 3)</p>
        <p>• Avoiding bad data (Chapter 2)</p>
        <p>• Keeping it casual (Chapter 4)</p>
        <p>• Pushing for commitment & advancement (Chapter 5)</p>
        <p>• Framing the meeting (Chapter 6)</p>
        <p>• Customer segmentation (Chapter 7)</p>
        <p>• Prepping & reviewing (Chapter 8)</p>
        <p>• Taking notes (Chapter 8)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The mom test:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>1. Talk about their life instead of your idea</p>
        <p>2. Ask about specifies in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future</p>
        <p>3. Talk less and listen more. [121]</p>
        </blockquote> 
        <p>The tools help, but you need to get out in the field. I've learned more from launching silly projects than I ever did from reading books or blogs. Make it happen. [126]</p>
