      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Trying to learn from customer conversations is like excavating a delicate archeological site. The truth is down there somewhere, but it’s fragile. [p.v]</p>
      <p>Bad customer conversations aren’t just useless. Worse they convince you that you’re on the right path. [p.vi]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>The measure of usefulness of an early customer conversation is whether it gives us concrete facts about our customers’ lives and world views. [p.5]</p>
      <p>The mom test: [p.7]</p>
      <blockquote>
          <p>• Talk about their life instead of your idea</p>
          <p>• Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future.</P>
          <p>• Talk less and listen more</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Only the market can tell you if your idea is good. Everything else is just opinion. [p.8]</p>
      <p>Ask them to show you how they currently do it . Talk about which parts they love and hate. Ask which other tools and processes they tried before settling on this one. [p.8]</p>
      <p>Ask how they currently solve X and how much it costs them to do so. And how much time it takes. Ask them to talk you through the last time X came up . [p.9]</p>
      <p><mark>People will lie to you if they think it’s what you want to hear. [p.10]</mark></p>
      <p>You don’t want to just collect feature request. You aren’t building the product by committee. But the motivations and constraints behind those requests are critical. [p.10]</p>
      <p>A question like “why do you bother” points towards their motivation. It gives you the why. [p.10]</p>
      <p><mark>Rule of thumb: Some problems don’t actually matter [p.11]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>Whenever possible, you want to be shown, not told by your customers. [p.11]</mark></p>
      <p>If you ran a burger joint, it would be stupid to survey your customers about wether they prefer cheeseburgers or hamburgers. Just watch what they buy (but if you’re trying to understand why they prefer one over the other, you’ll have to talk to them. [p.11] </p>
      <p>Rule of thumb: Watching someone do a task will show you where the problems and inefficiencies really are, not where the customer thinks they are. [p.12]</p>
      <p>Rule of thumb: If they haven’t looked for ways of solving it already, they are not going to look for (or buy) yours. [p.13]</p>
      <p>Common wisdom is that you price your product in terms of value to the customer rather than cost to you. And you can’t quantify the value received without prodding their financial worldview. [p.13]</p>
      <p>Rule of thumb: People stop lying when you ask them for money. [p.13]</p>
      <p>Rule of thumb: While it’s rare that someone will tell you precisely what they’ll pay you, they’ll often show you what it’s worth to them. [p.14]</p>
