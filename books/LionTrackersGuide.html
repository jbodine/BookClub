      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The unbroken stream of life that animates all things is supremely intelligent, and nothing in the wild needs a coach to help it discover what it truly is. [xvi]</p>
      <p>No one can tell you what your track will be or how to know what calls you and brings you to life. That’s your work to do. But a great tracker can ask: how do you know you love something. [xvii]</p>
