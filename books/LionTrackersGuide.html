      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The unbroken stream of life that animates all things is supremely intelligent, and nothing in the wild needs a coach to help it discover what it truly is. [xvi]</p>
      <p>No one can tell you what your track will be or how to know what calls you and brings you to life. That’s your work to do. But a great tracker can ask: how do you know you love something. [xvii]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>Alex's house is on the outskirts of the village, which seems appropriate. He lives on the fringe where civilization gives way to wilderness. His house is positioned at the limits of his tolerance for the domestic. [3]</p>
      <p>To me a master is anyone who can be themselves in any situation. [10]</p>
      <p>The unknown is a discipline of wildness, and wildness is a relationship with aliveness. Too much uncertainty is chaos, but too little is death. [14]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>That's how mentors should be made: not through titles or words but through actions. On the ground, in the face of a leopard, one feels acutely alone. To be guided in a moment like that, with such extreme stakes, creates a bond that is rare in modern life. [21]</p>
      <p>Behind the wheel of the Landy, the engine sputters and chokes as I fire the ignition. A little puff of smoke in the clear air and we are off. Alex sits next to me and Renias sits up on a seat welded to the hood called the tracker seat. [22]</p>
      <p>Animals tend to move during these cool hours just after sunrise. The low light creates contrast on the ground, causing tracks to pop. The magnetism of these early hours is palpable. Later, the morning will warm, the cats will move to the shade, and the dawn energy will give way to a lazy heat. The witching hour in Africa is the middle of the day, still and hot and unmoving. The middle of the day is more a time for ghosts than midnight is. [23]</p>
      <p>Renas has been out in the bush every morning of his life. He is fifty-five years old. And each day he looks at it anew and asks "Why?" [25]</p>
      <p><mark>The owl (the pel’s fishing owl) is a symbol that you are in a wild place where few people will ever venture; where the environment conveys a nature deep within your own being. There's a low-lying depression and anxiety plaguing modern life - a symptom of an undiagnosed home-sickness to feel a belonging to the greater ecosystem and know ourselves in relation rather than isolation. [26]</mark></p>
      <p>Life is full of information. "You must train yourself to see what you are looking for." [30]</p>
      <p>You have to follow the inner tracks of your feelings, sensations, and instincts, the integrity and truth that are deeper than ideas about what you should do. You have to learn to follow a deeper, wiser, wilder place inside yourself. [30]</p>
      <p><mark>No one can tell you what your track will be or how to know what calls you and brings you to life. That's your work to do. But a great tracker can ask: How do you know you love something? How do you feel when you are fully expressing yourself? Learn that feeling and then start looking, not for the thing, but for the feeling. [31-32]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p>No matter how good the relationship, there is a tension between father and son. [33]</p>
      <p>I could hear his father and his father's father's voice barking out of his mouth. A trauma pattern traveling through time.[36]</p>
      <p><mark>Trauma can travel, but so can healing. [37]</mark></p>
      <p>Alex would let me lead and then guide me when I lost the track, but the feeling was always of tracking together. It was a subtle sharing that felt supportive but not condescending. [38]</p>
      <p>I felt the gratitude of being taught. When someone shares with you, you become someone who wants to share. [38]</p>
      <p>I had always thought that I needed to be somebody in the world. That rhino and the path he walked told me something different: don't try to be someone, rather find the thing that is so engaging that it makes you forget yourself. [41]</p>
      <p><mark>The track of the father is to find him within you. To find what he gave you and what he didn't give you. You must use both sides. [42]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      <p>Sometimes the body will have to get sick before we will listen to what it is saying to us. [44]</p>
      <p>He does not set out into the unlikely chance of finding a lion in the future. He works with what he has now, in the moment. [47]</p>
      <p>I thought of all the people who had told me that when they knew exactly what they wanted to do, they would leave the soul-destroying thing that they were currently involved with. Obsessed with perfection and doing it right, we want to go straight to the "lion." [49]</p>
      <p><mark>We don't realize the significance of the path of first tracks and how to be invested in a discovery rather than an outcome. [49]</mark></p>
      <p>The bush is not a place of inevitable menace, as it is often portrayed in movies and on the endless shows about deadly creatures on the wildlife networks. The bush simply has its way. If we respect this and pay attention, we belong here as much as any other animal. But the margins for error are small, and the way one behaves in a high-risk situation is critical. Yet for all of us a life with no sharp edges would be worse. The hazard of modern times is the danger of no danger. [51]</p>
      <p>You have been told what to be and want. This realization is immense as it is the beginning of a much deeper question about what we actually want. You are your outlook, and that outlook is not universal. [54]</p>
      <p><mark>It was St. Francis who said, "Wherever you go, preach the gospel; when necessary use words." Depicted as the
        only Christian saint looking down to the earth rather than upward to God, he has always held a deep appeal for me. It was St. Francis who gave up the life of a rich merchant's son that had been ordained for him and decided to go forth on a different trail and live simply in nature. [55]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      <p>It's hard to know when to stay on a trail and when to divert. It's hard to know when the lesson is to persist and when the lesson is to let it go. I think of all the angst I have felt between choices. I've been paralyzed by options and the idea that there is a single right way. [59]</p>
      <p><mark>You use your intention, take action, and let go. The bush teaches us that the lesson is more about discovery than being correct. On the trail there is not one way; the only mistake is to not make any choice. As it is in life. [59]</mark></p>
      <p>He sketched the flow of water across the land and connected the movement of water to soil types and flora, which in turn informed the distribution of animals [65]</p>
      <p><mark>The men I admired made choices against all convention and rationale. They followed something deep within. [66]</mark></p>
      <p>As paradoxical as it sounds, going down a path and not finding a track is part of finding the track…The path of not here is part of the path of here. [68]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
      <p><mark>Accept that losing the track is part of tracking. Go back to the last clear track. There is information there.[73]</mark></p>
      <p>Any place you don't find a track is not wasted, but part of refining where to look. Flow for a while on your best guess, alert, listening, noticing. [74]</p>
      <p>I think of all the people I have spoken to who have said, "When I know exactly what the next thing is, I will make
        a move." I think of all the people whom I have taught to track who froze when they lost the track, wanting to be
        certain of the right path forward before they would move. Trackers try things. The tracker on a lost track enters a process of rediscovery that is fluid. [74-75]</p>
        <p><mark>No action is considered a waste, and the key is to keep moving, readjusting, welcoming feedback [75]</mark></p>
        <p>In its simplest form, coaching begins by asking a person, "How does that make you feel? "Terrible," they often reply, and then the coach says, "Well, then don't do it." This seemingly ridiculous statement can cause seismic shifts in people. We have become so unnatural and patterned and socialized that some of us don't even know what feels good or bad. We operate on autopilot. [75]</p>
        <p>Your beliefs about life are not reality. A great coach asks you to question your deeply held beliefs and rules for yourself. You can go only as far into the experience of creating life as the limits of your personal belief system will allow. [76]</p>
        <p><mark>I am astounded by the simplicity of this. Track what makes you feel good and bring more of it into your life. Notice what makes you feel lousy and do less of it. [76]</mark></p>
        <p>A landscape, like a person or a psyche, learns to defend itself. With hundreds of cattle on the land, the grass had been overgrazed, leaving bare soil. When the rain came, the water would run off and cut deep erosive furrows into the earth. The arid landscape could not receive the nourishment it needed. I saw this too in every ceremony I attended, how trauma keeps a person from connecting with what they most need. [82]</p>
        <p>When my family had first arrived, they had thought that this was simply the way the land was. If something is all you have ever known, you mistakenly believe that's just how it is. Perhaps this is the greatest danger, that we don't even recognize another way." [82]</p>
        <p>They rented an old bulldozer and began to smash up the scrub. "This is utter destruction, my father said when he looked at the land after a day of clearing scrub. "Trust me," Ken said. "Trust the process. It's not gonna look pretty, but allow nature time to respond." [83]</p>
        <p>Slowly, methodically, they cleared the scrub away and packed it into the erosive furrows. It stabilized the furrows so the water no longer ran off, and this allowed it to be absorbed by the ground. That groundwater replenished the parched earth and something miraculous started to happen: the pattern of the landscape was changing. The grasses came back and the scrub no longer grew. In the new grasslands, animals started to appear. My father to this day cannot contain the joy of those days as they watched the animals return. Herds of zebra and wildebeest began to flock onto the scrubless terrain. Rhinos walked into the open grassland. And herds of impala grazed in the evening light. The land was becoming itself again. [83-84]</p>
        <p>My career had come to life and yet I still felt there was something more I was meant to do. It had been an incredible learning journey and it all began when I lost the track. [86]</p>
        <p><mark>My lost track turned to first tracks and then trails. [86]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
      <p>Men and women search for intimacy, but what they really need is wildness. A person who is in touch with the wild self answers a partner's questions in aliveness and presence--a different, more vital kind of conversation." [90]</p>
      <p>We have crossed the threshold from tracking into just walking. The trail of the buffalo herd shreds the ground, but the lion has grown wings. [91]</p>
      <p>You cant think your way to a calling. You have to learn how your body speaks. You have to learn how you know what you know. You have to follow the inner tracks of your feelings, sensations, and instincts, the integrity and truth that are deeper than ideas about what you should do. [92]</p>
      <p>So often we dichotomize between big-picture thinkers and details people. What Native Americans used to call "eagle vision" and "mouse vision. Trackers embody both ways of seeing. They move seam lessly between these two states. [93]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
      <p>Everything in modern life seems to be about security. We are constantly sold our own fears. We strive for security, but at what cost? [100]</p>
      <p><mark>To this day I wonder about the courage I found underneath the fear. I wonder if I could find it again. I wonder if it is wrong to look for it. I know that one of the great dangers of my life would be to live without danger. K[103]</mark></p>
      <p>In our encounters with the edges, we come to know ourselves more deeply [103]</p>
      <p>Fearfulness is the most common state in a life that asks for no real courage. [103]</p>
      <p>I know that fear has something to teach me. [103]</p>
      <p>While a trail can flow under the eye of a master, it is often a process of nonlinear problem solving. The story never goes like you want it to. The eagle is not the sign you thought it was. The lions start hunting and split up. The track runs cold. [105]</p>
      <p>Staring daily at screens, we have lost what a far horizon does to the spirit. [107]</p>
      <p>Track what makes you feel good and bring more of it into your life. Notice what makes you feel lousy and do less of it [111]</p>
      <p><mark>People are not looking for the meaning of life, they are looking for the feeling of being alive. [113]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
      <p>We area society that lives in denial of death and so we are a society that denies life. [128]</p>
      <p>Humility is the liberation from illusions of dominance, control, and power. [128]</p>
      <p>It feels short to me, almost anticlimactic. But Ren and Alex were never motivated by the outcome. They live on the trail. [130]</p>

      <h2>Epilogue</h2>
      <p>Amidst all of the information that surrounds us. learn to see what is deeply important to you. Use the feelings in your body as a guide. Live on first tracks. [135]</p>
      <p>Anything that puts you into your essence, no matter how small, is valuable. [135]</p>
