    <section>
      <h2>Accessibility</h2>
      <p>Objects and environments should be designed to be usable, without modification, by as many people as possible. There are four characteristics of accessible designs: perceptibility, operability, simplicity, and forgiveness. [p.16]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Aesthetic-Usability Effect</h2>
      <p>Aesthetic designs are perceived as easier to use than less-aesthetic designs. They also foster positive relationships with people, making them more tolerant of problems. [p.20]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Affordance</h2>
      <p>A property in which the physical characteristics of an object or environment influence its function. When the affordance of an object or environment corresponds with it's intended function, the design will perform more efficiently. [p.22]</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Anthropomorphic form</h2>
      <p>A tendency to find forms that appear humanoid or exhibit humanlike characteristics appealing. Humans are predisposed to perceive certain forms and patterns as humanlike — specifically forms and patterns that resemble faces and body proportions. The classic 1915 Coca-cola "contour" bottle, often referred to as the "Mae West" bottle due to its distinctly feminine proportions. [p.26]</p>

      <h2>Biophilia Effect</h2>
      <p>Environments rich in nature views and imagery reduce stress and enhance focus and concentration. Exposure to nature confers benefits emotionally, cognitively, and physically. Consider the biophilia effect in the design of all environments, but in particular, environments in which learning, healing, and concentration are paramount. [p.36]</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Chunking</h2>
      <p>A technique of combining many units of information into a limited number of units or chunks, so that the information is easier to process and remember. Chunking seeks to accommodate short-term memory limits by formatting information into a small number of units. Chunk information when people are required to recall and retain information, or when information is used for problem-solving. Do not chunk information that is to be searched or scanned. The maximum number of chunks that can be efficiently processed by short-term memory is four, plus or minus one. [p.40]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Closure</h2>
      <p>A tendency to perceive a set of individual elements as a single, recognizable pattern, rather than multiple individual elements. [p.44]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Cognitive Dissonance</h2>
      <p>A tendency to seek consistency among attitudes, thoughts, and beliefs. [p.46]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Color</h2>
      <p>Color is used in design to attract attention, group elements, indicate meaning, and enhance aesthetics. Use color conservatively. Limi the palette to what the eye can process at one glance (about five colors depending on complexity). Do not use color as the only means to impart information since a significant portion of the population has limited color vision. Different cultures attach different meanings to colors. Therefore, verify the meaning of colors and color combinations for a particular target audience prior to use. Use saturated (pure hues) when attracting attention and desaturated colors when performance and efficiency are the priority. [p.48]</p>
