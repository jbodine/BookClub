      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I was often assigned tasks that lacked purpose or a clear direction. [13]</p>
      <p>First, there was never any consensus about what projects or initiatives to work on; no one was able to agree on what to prioritize. Second, there was no clear, unified system in place for the actual running of a project. Third, poor communication during the project stifled creativity and progress. [15]</p>
      <p><mark>In most companies, people are doing what they're actually paid to do 10% of the time and 90% of the time they are responding to the messiness of poor teamwork, bad planning, and strained team dynamics. [15-16]</mark></p>
      <p>I’d had a major "aha" moment, realizing what the problem had been all along. The problem was that we (me, my clients, my previous employer, and virtually every company I'd ever come into contact with) didn't have a recipe for starting projects, structuring discussions, and committing to a plan of action to get meaningful work done. [18]</p>

      <h2>Section 1</h2>
      <p>There was one critical factor in the success or failure of a sprint: the facilitator. [25]</p>

      <h2>Section 2 </h2>
      <p><blockquote>
        <p>1. Collect: Every workshop needs to start with a phase of information collection. This can be where a team comes together to collect challenges, ideas, data, inspiration, or anything that could come up in an open conversation. The data collected then needs to be visualized for all participants to see. The Collect phase is where the scope of work for a project or challenge is defined.</p>
        <p>2. Choose: Once enough content and data has been collected, it's time to choose what to focus on and what to ignore.</p>
        <p>3. Create: Solutions don't need to be final, or even well thought-out - at this point it's more about creating multiple potential solutions.</p>
        <p>4. Commit: A workshop is useless without actionable takeaways, unless the goal was purely about inspiring the team. [36-37]</p>
      </blockquote></p>
    </section>

      <h2>Collect </h2>
      <p>The goal of the collect phase is to collect challenges and data from a team, then visualize it in a way that's easy for everyone to understand. [44]</p>
      <p>Spend a few minutes asking your team to call out what other categories they see. Write these as they call them out and start creating a horizontal list of categories. [51]</p>
      <p>Create vertical stacks of challenges underneath each category. [51]</p>
      <p>The collect phase is about quantity over quality - we want to generate a large volume of information. [52]</p>
      <p><mark>The end goal of the collect phase is to visualize the information collected in a way that's easy for the team to scan and understand. [52]</mark></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Choose</h2>
      <p>Without a clear framework for making choices, endless conversation will always happen. [55]</p>
      <p>The simple goal of the choose phase of a workshop is to help a team choose what to work on, what to focus on and what to ignore for now. [56]</p>
      <p>[Understand] What's causing the most trouble? [57]</p>
      <p>Tell them to vote on what they consider to be the biggest issues holding the team back when it comes to the problem we're tackling. They are voting on the challenges, not on the categories. [57]</p>
      <p>Prioritize the challenges [58]</p>
      <p>Create a vertical stack of the stickies in order of most votes to least, ignore anything with one vote or less. [58]</p>
      <p>Ruthlessly prioritize, having too many ideas to bring forward will complicate things. [59]</p>
      <p><mark>Re-write these top-voted challenges as opportunity questions (or "How Might We's"). [60]</mark></p>
      <p>The choose phase is all about prioritization and selecting a challenge: choosing what to focus on, and what not to focus on. [61]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Create</h2>
      <p>The goal of the create phase of a workshop is to generate lots of solutions to the prioritized problem. [64]</p>
      <p>"Solutions don't need to be final, or even well thought-out - at this point it's more about creating a mass of solutions." [64]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Commit</h2>
      <p><mark>Companies don't have a problem coming up with good ideas, no, companies have plenty of ideas! The problem is that they can't choose which ones to commit to and execute and which ones to ignore. [73]</mark></p>
      <p>Unless we can commit actually executing a few of these solutions, they were pointless to come up with in the first place. [77]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <P>1. How impactful each idea is according to the team.</P>
        <p>2. How difficult each idea will be to implement.</p>
      </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>As the facilitator, are going to turn this idea into something actionable. A plan for someone to execute. To do this you're going to create a simple "2 Week Experiment" based on the idea and you're also going to add simple "success criteria" on a separate sticky note. [79]</p>
