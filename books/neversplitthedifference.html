      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>I was employing what had become the FBI’s most potent negotiating tools: the open ended question. [3]</p>
      <p>We call this tactic calibrated questions: queries that the other side can respond to but that have no fixed answers. It buys you time. It gives your counterpart the illusion of control. [3]</p>
      <p>Our techniques were the product experiential learning; they were developed by agents in the field, negotiating through crisis and sharing stories of what succeeded and what failed. It was an iterative process, not an intellectual one. [4]</p>
      <p>All the raw intelligence and mathematical logic in the world is little help in the fraught, shifting interplay of two people negotiating. [8]</p>
      <p>Hostage taking - and therefore hostage negotiating - has existed since the dawn of recorded time. The Old Testament spins plenty of tales of Israelites and their enemies taking each other’s citizens hostage as spoils of war. The romans, for their part, used to force the princes of vassal states to send their sons to Rome from their education, to ensure the continued loyalty of the princes. [9]</p>
      <p>Their (Roger Fisher and William Ury - authors of getting to yes) core assumption was that the emotional brain - that animalistic, unreliable, and irrational beast - could be overcome through a more rational, joint problem-solving mindset. [11]</p>
      <p>Their system was easy to follow and seductive, with four basic tenants. One, separate the person - the emotion - from the problem; two don’t get wrapped up in the other side’s position (what they’re asking for) but instead focus on their interests (why they’re asking for it) so that you can find what they really want; three, work cooperatively to generate win-win options; and, four, establish mutually agreed-upon standards for evaluating those possible solutions. [11]</p>
      <p>“It is self-evident that people are neither fully rational nor completely selfish, and that their tastes are anything but stable.” - Daniel Kahenman [12]</p>
      <p>The framing effect, demonstrates that people respond differently to the same choice depending on how it is framed. [12]</p>
      <p>Prospect theory explains why we take unwarranted risks in the face of uncertain losses. [12]</p>
      <p>Loss aversion shows how people are statistically more likely to act to avert a loss than achieve an equal gain. [12]</p>
      <p><mark>“Man, he wrote, has two systems of thought: System 1, our animal mind, is fast, instinctive, and emotional; System 2 is slow, deliberative, and logical. And system 1 is far more influential. In fact, it guides and steers our rational thoughts” - Kahneman [12]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>We react emotionally (system 1) to a suggestion or question. Then that system 1 reaction informs and in effect creates the system 2 answer.[12]</mark> </p>
      <p>If you know how to affect your counterpart’s system 1 thinking, his inarticulate feelings, by how you frame and deliver your questions and statements, then you can guide his system 2 rationality and therefore modify his responses. [12-13]</p>
      <p>Hostage negotiations were (are) anything but rational problem-solving situations. [13]</p>
      <p>Have you ever tried to devise a mutually beneficial win-win solution with a guy who thinks he’s the messiah? It was becoming glaringly obvious the Getting To Yes didn’t work with kidnappers. [14]</p>
      <p>If emotionally driven incidents, not rational bargaining interactions, constituted the bulk of what most police negotiators had to deal with, then our negotiating skills had to laser-focus on the animal, emotional, and irrational. [15]</p>
      <p><mark>People want to be understood and accepted. Listening is the cheapest, yet most effective concession we can make to get there. [16]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>Contrary to popular opinion, listening is not a passive activity It is the most active thing you can do. [16]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>Life is negotiation. The majority of the interactions we have at work and at home are negotiations that boil down to the expression of a simple, animalistic urge: I want. [17]</mark></p>
      <p>Negotiating is not browbeating or grinding someone down. It simply means playing the emotional game that human society is set up for. [18]</p>
      <p><mark>It’s vitally important to get to, “No”, because “No” starts the negotiation. [20]</mark></p>
      <p>Queries that begin with “How?” Or “What?” By eliminating “Yes” and “No” answers (they) force your counterpart to apply their mental energy to solving your problems. [20]</p>
      <p>To successfully negotiate it is critical to prepare. [21]</p>
      <p>Negotiation is the heart of collaboration It is what makes conflicts potentially meaningful and productive for all parties. [21]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>Good negotiators, going in, know they have to be ready for possible surprises; great negotiators aim to use their skills to reveal the surprises they are certain exist. [24]</p>
      <p>In negotiation, each new phycological insight or additional piece of information revealed heralds a step forward and allows one to discard on hypothesis in favor of another. You should engage the process with a mindset of discovery. [25]</p>
      <p><mark>Your goal at the outset is to extract and observe as much information as possible. [25]</mark></p>
      <p>Too often people find it easier just to stick with what they believe. [25]</p>
      <p>They often make assumptions about others even before meeting them. [25]</p>
      <p>Be aware of a counterpart’s overuse of personal pronouns – we/they/ or me/I. The less important he makes himself, the more important he probably is (and vice versa). [25-26]</p>
      <p>Until you know what you’re dealing with, you don’t know what you’re dealing with. [26]</p>
      <p>It’s really not that easy to listen well. [27]</p>
      <p>For those people who view negotiation as a battle of arguments, it’s the voices in their own head that are overwhelming them. When they’re not talking, they’re thinking about their arguments, and when they are talking, they’re making their arguments. [28]</p>
      <p><mark>Instead of prioritizing your argument – in face, instead of doing any thinking at all in the early goings about what you’re going to say – make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say. [28]</mark></p>
      <p>The goal is to identify what your counterparts actually need (monetarily, emotionally, or otherwise) and get them feeling safe enough to talk and talk and talk some more about what they want. The latter will help you discover the former. [28]</p>
      <p><mark>Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making. If we’re too much in a hurry, people can feel as if they’re not being heard and we risk undermining the rapport and trustee’ve built. [30]</mark></p>
      <p>When you slow the process down, you also calm it down. [30]</p>
      <p>People tend to focus all their energies on what to say or do, but it's how we are (our general demeanor and delivery) that is both the easiest thing to enact and the most immediately effective mode of influence. Our brains don't just process and understand the actions and words of others but their feelings and intentions too. [32]</p>
      <p>When we radiate warmth and acceptance, conversations just seem to flow. When we enter a room with a level of comfort and enthusiasm, we attract people toward us. Smile at someone on the street, and as a reflex they'll smile back. Understanding that reflex and putting it into practice is critical to the success of just about every negotiating skill there is to learn. [32]</p>
      <p>The key here is to relax and smile while you're talking. [33]</p>
      <p>You can be very direct and to the point as long as you create safety by a tone of voice that says I'm okay, you're okay, let's figure things out. [34]</p>
      <p><mark>We fear what's different and are drawn to what's similar. [36]</mark></p>
      <p>For the FBI, a "mirror" is when you repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said. [36]</p>
      <p><mark>Being right isn't the key to a successful negotiation- having the right mindset is. [43]</mark></p>
      <p>If you take a pit bull approach with another pit bull, you generally end up with a messy scene and lots of bruised feelings and resentment. Luckily, there's another way without all the mess. It's just four simple steps: [44]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. Use the late-night FM DJ voice.</p>
        <p>2. Start with "I'm sorry ...</p>
        <p>3. Mirror.</p>
        <p>4. Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on your counterpart.</p>
        <p>5. Repeat.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The intention behind most mirrors should be "Please, help me understand. [45]</p>
      <p><mark>Negotiation is not an act of battle; it's a process of discovery. The goal is to un cover as much information as possible. [47]</mark></p>
      <p>To quiet the voices in your head, make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say. [47]</p>
      <p>Slow. It. Down. [47]</p>
      <p>Put a smile on your face. [47]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p>Emotions are one of the main things that derail communication. Once people get upset at one another, rational thinking goes out the window. [49]</p>
      <p>Instead of denying or ignoring emotions, good negotiators identify and influence them. [50]</p>
      <p>You can learn almost everything you need--and a lot more than other people would like you to know- simply by watching and listening, keeping your eyes peeled and your ears open, and your mouth shut. [50]</p>
      <p>Empathy is paying attention to another human being, asking what they are feeling, and making a commitment to understanding their world. Notice I didn't say anything about agreeing with the other person's values and beliefs or giving out hugs. That's sympathy. [52]</p>
      <p><mark>Most of us enter verbal combat unlikely to persuade anyone of anything because we only know and care about our own goals and perspective. [52]</mark></p>
      <p>Empathy is not about being nice or agreeing with the other side. It's about understanding them. [53]</p>
      <p>Labeling is a way of validating someone's emotion by acknowledging it. [54]</p>
      <p>In other words, labeling an emotion-applying rational words to a fear-disrupts its raw intensity. [55]</p>
      <p>Most of the time you'll have a wealth of information from the other person's words, tone, and body language. [55]</p>
      <p>Labels almost always begin with roughly the same words: It seems like, It sounds like, It looks like. Notice we said "It sounds like "and not" I’m hearing that. That's because the word “I” gets people's guard up! [56]</p>
      <p>The last rule of labeling is silence. [56]</p>
      <p>The fastest and most efficient means of establishing a quick working relationship is to acknowledge the negative and diffuse it. [59]</p>
      <p>In any interaction, it pleases us to feel that the other side is listening and acknowledging our situation. [71]</p>
      <p>The reasons why a counterpart will not make an agreement with you are often more powerful than why they will make a deal, so focus first on clearing the barriers to agreement. [72]</p>
      <p>Pause. After you label a barrier or mirror a statement, let it sink in. [72]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      <p>"Yes" is often a meaningless answer that hides deeper objections (and "Maybe" is even worse). Pushing hard for "Yes" doesn't get a negotiator any closer to a win; it just angers the other side. [75]</p>
      <p>For good negotiators, "No" is pure gold. That negative provides a great opportunity for you and the other party to clarify what you really want by eliminating what you don't want. [75]</p>
      <p><mark>“No" is the start of the negotiation, not the end of it. [78]</mark></p>
      <p>People need to feel in control. [78]</p>
      <p>When someone tells you "No," you need to rethink the word in one of its alternative--and much more real-meanings: I am not yet ready to agree; You are making me feel uncomfortable; I do not understand; I don't think I can afford it; I want something else; I need more information; or I want to talk it over with someone else. Then, after pausing, ask solution-based questions or simply label their effect: "What about this doesn't work for you? [79]</p>
      <p>There are actually three kinds of "Yes": Counterfeit, Confirmation, and Commitment. [80]</p>
      <p><mark>Though the intensity may differ from person to person, you can be sure that everyone you meet is driven by two primal urges: the need to feel safe and secure, and the need to feel in control. If you satisfy those drives, you're in the door. [84</mark></p>
      <p><mark>Being "nice" in the form of feigned sympathy is often equally as unsuccessful. [85]</mark></p>
      <p>An early "Yes" is often just a cheap, counterfeit dodge. [85]</p>
      <p>Use a question that prompts a "No" answer, and your counterpart feels that by turning you down he has proved that he's in the driver's seat. [86]</p>
      <p>There is a big difference between making your counterpart feel that they can say "No" and actually getting them to say it. [91]</p>
      <p>"No" - or the lack thereof - also serves as a warning, the canary in the coal mine. If despite all your efforts, the other party won't say "No," you're dealing with people who are indecisive or confused or who have a hidden agenda. In cases like that you have to end the negotiation and walk away. [91-92]</p>

      <h2>Chatper 5</h2>
      <p>The sweetest two words in any negotiation are actually "That's right." [98]</p>
      <p>One crucial aspect of any negotiation is to figure out how your adversary arrived at his position. [99]</p>
      <p>Tactic in the active listening arsenal: [103]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. Effective Pauses: Silence is powerful.</p>
        <p>2. Minimal Encouragers.</p>
        <p>3. Mirroring.</p>
        <p>4. Labeling.</p>
        <p>5. Paraphrase: Benjie should repeat what Sabaya is saying back to him in Benjie's own words. This, we told him, would powerfully show him you really do understand and aren't merely parroting his concerns.</p>
        <p>6. Summarize: A good summary is the combination of re-articulating the meaning of what is said plus the acknowledgment of the emotions underlying that meaning (paraphrasing + labeling = summary).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Humans have an innate urge toward socially constructive behavior. The more a person feels understood, and positively affirmed in that understanding, the more likely that urge for constructive behavior will take hold. [112]</p>
      <p>The building blocks of a good summary are a label combined with paraphrasing. [112]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
      <p>There's always leverage. Negotiation is never a linear formula: add X to Y to get Z. We all have irrational blind spots, hidden needs, and undeveloped notions. [114]</p>
      <p>The win-win mindset pushed by so many negotiation experts is usually ineffective and often disastrous. At best, it satisfies neither side. And if you employ it with a counterpart who has a win-lose approach, you're setting yourself up to be swindled. [115]</p>
      <p><mark>We don't compromise because it's right; we compromise because it is easy and because it saves face. We compromise in order to say that at least we got half the pie. Distilled to its essence, we compromise to be safe. [116]</mark></p>
      <p>You've got to embrace the hard stuff. That's where the great deals are. [116]</p>
      <p>Time is one of the most crucial variables in any negotiation. [116]</p>
      <p>Deadlines are often arbitrary, almost always flexible, and hardly ever trigger the consequences we think- or are told- they will. [117]</p>
      <p>When the negotiation is over for one side, it's over for the other too. [119]</p>
      <p><mark>If you approach a negotiation thinking that the other guy thinks like you, you're wrong. [121]</mark></p>
      <p>Emotion is a necessary element to decision making that we ignore at our own peril. [122]</p>
      <p>While we may use logic to reason ourselves toward a decision, the actual decision making is governed by emotion. [122]</p>
      <p>The best response either way is to take a deep breath and restrain your desire to concede. Then say, "Okay, I apologize. Let's stop everything and go back to where I started treating you unfairly and we'll fix it. [125]</p>
      <p>Prospect Theory. Created in 1979 by the psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, prospect theory describes how people choose between options that involve risk, like in a negotiation. The theory argues that people are drawn to sure things over probabilities, even when the probability is a better choice. That's called the Certainty Effect. And people will take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains. That's called Loss Aversion. [127]</p>
      <p>In a tough negotiation, it's not enough to show the other party that you can deliver the thing they want. To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through. [128]</p>
      <p>Start out with an accusation audit acknowledging all of their fears. By anchoring their emotions in preparation for a loss, you inflame the other side's loss aversion so that they'll jump at the chance to avoid it. [128]</p>
      <p>Let the other guy go first... most of the time. [129]</p>
      <p>Job applicants who named a range received significantly higher overall salaries than those who offered a number, especially if their range was a "bolstering range," in which the low number in the range was what they actually wanted. [131]</p>
      <p>One of the easiest ways to bend your counterpart's reality to your point of view is by pivoting to non-monetary terms. [132]</p>
      <p>When you do talk numbers, use odd ones. [132]</p>
      <p>People feel obliged to repay debts of kindness. [133]</p>
      <p>The more you talk about non-salary terms, the more likely you are to hear the full range of their options. [135]</p>
      <p>Once you've negotiated a salary, make sure to define success for your position- as well as metrics for your next raise. [135]</p>
      <p>Ask: "What does it take to be successful here?" [136]</p>
      <p>The key issue here is if someone gives you guidance, they will watch to see if you follow their advice. They will have a personal stake in seeing you succeed. [136]</p>
      <p>All negotiations are defined by a network of subterranean desires and needs. Don't let yourself be fooled by the surface. [139]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
      <p>Negotiation was coaxing, not overcoming; co-opting, not defeating. [141]</p>
      <p>The calibrated, or open ended, question. What it does is remove aggression from conversations by acknowledging the other side openly, without resistance. In doing so, it lets you introduce ideas and requests without sounding pushy. It allows you to nudge. [141]</p>
      <p><mark>Don't try to negotiate in a firefight. [142]</mark></p>
      <p>We didn't ask the kidnappers to talk directly to the hostage because we knew they'd say "no" and we were afraid of being embarrassed. That fear was a major flaw in our negotiating mindset. There is some information that you can only get through direct, extended interactions with your counterpart. [147]</p>
      <p><mark>We wanted them to see things our way and they wanted us to see it their way. If you let this dynamic loose in the real world, negotiation breaks down and tensions flare. [147]</mark></p>
      <p>All negotiation, done well, should be an information-gathering process that vests your counterpart in an outcome that serves you. [147]</p>
      <p>Whether we like to recognize it or not, a universal rule of human nature, across all cultures, is that when somebody gives you something, they expect something in return. And they won't give anything else until you pay them back. [148]</p>
      <p>Instead of asking some closed-ended question with a single correct answer, he'd asked an open-ended, yet calibrated one that forced the other guy to pause and actually think about how to solve the problem. [149]</p>
      <p>It's a "how" question, and "how" engages because "how" asks for help. [149]</p>
      <p>“Unbelief," which is active resistance to what the other side is saying, complete rejection. That's where the two parties in a negotiation usually start. [149]</p>
      <p>As the saying goes, the best way to ride a horse is in the direction in which it is going. [150]</p>
      <p>Giving your counterpart the illusion of control by asking calibrated questions--by asking for help--is one of the most powerful tools for suspending unbelief. [150]</p>
      <p>Calibrated questions avoid verbs or words like "can," "is," "are,” "does." These are closed-ended questions that can be answered with a simple "yes" or a "no." Instead, they start with a list of words people know as reporter's questions: "who," "what," "when, "where," "why," and "how." [153]</p>
      <p>It's best to start with "what, "how," and sometimes "why" nothing else. '"Who," "when," and "where" will often just get your counterpart to share a fact without thinking. And "why" can backfire. [153]</p>
      <p><mark>As always, tone of voice, respectful and deferential, is critical. [154]</mark></p>
      <p>You can use "what" and "how" to calibrate nearly any question. "Does this look like something you would like?” can become "How does this look to you?" or "What about this works for you?" You can even ask, "What about this doesn't work for you?" and you'll probably trigger quite a bit of useful information from your counterpart. [154]</p>
      <p>Even something as harsh as "Why did you do it?" can be calibrated to "What caused you to do it?" which takes away the emotion and makes the question less accusatory. [154]</p>
      <p>Use in the beginning of nearly every negotiation. "What is the biggest challenge you face?" [154]</p>
      <p>What about this is important to you? [154]</p>
      <p>Without self-control and emotional regulation, it doesn't work. [156]</p>
      <p>If you can't control your own emotions, how can you expect to influence the emotions of another party? [156]</p>
      <p>The first and most basic rule of keeping your emotional cool is to bite your tongue. [158]</p>
      <p><mark>Another simple rule is, when you are verbally assaulted, do not counterattack. [159]</mark></p>
      <p>When people feel that they are not in control, they adopt what psychologists call a hostage mentality. That is, in moments of conflict they react to their lack of power by either becoming extremely defensive or lashing out. [159]</p>
      <p>Who has control in a conversation, the guy listening or the guy talking? The listener, of course. That's because the talker is revealing information. [160]</p>
      <p><mark>"Why" is always an accusation, in any language. [160]</mark></p>
    </section>

      <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
      <p><mark>Your job as a negotiator isn't just to get to an agreement. It's getting to one that can be implemented and making sure that happens. [163]</mark></p>
      <p>The trick to "How" questions is that, correctly used, they are gentle and graceful ways to say "No" and guide your counterpart to develop a better solution--your solution. [167]</p>
      <p><mark>Pay attention to your voice. [168]</mark></p>
      <p>A deal is nothing without good implementation. [169]</p>
      <p>People always make more effort to implement a solution when they think it's theirs. [169]</p>
      <p>Be wary of two telling signs that your counterpart doesn't believe the idea is theirs. As I've noted, when they say, "You're right," it's often a good indicator they are not vested in what is being discussed. And when you push for implementation and they say, "I'll try.” [169]</p>
      <p>"Yes" is nothing without "How." So keep asking "How?" [169]</p>
      <p>There are almost always other players, people who can act as deal makers or deal killers. If you truly want to get to "Yes" and get your deal implemented, you have to discover how to affect these individuals. [170-171]</p>
      <p>Asking a few calibrated questions, like “How does this affect the rest of your team?" or "How on board are the people not on this call?" or simply "What do your colleagues see as their main challenges in this area?" [171]</p>
      <p>At the end of the day, the deal killers often are more important than the deal makers. [171]</p>
      <p><mark>A surprisingly high percentage of negotiations hinge on something outside dollars and cents, often having more to do with self-esteem, status, and other non-financial needs. [172]</mark></p>
      <p>As a negotiator, you're going to run into guys who lie to your face and try to scare you into agreement. Aggressive jerks and serial fabricators come with the territory, and dealing with them is something you have to do. [172]</p>
      <p>It's best not to go chin to chin with aggressiveness, default to using "what" and "how" questions to avoid making bids or adjusting your own negotiating position. Dodge and weave. [175]</p>
      <p><mark>Only 7 percent of a message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from the tone of voice and 55 percent from the speaker's body language and face. [176]</mark></p>
      <p>Body language and tone of voice-not words-are our most powerful assessment tools. [176]</p>
      <p>Pay very close attention to tone and body language to make sure they match up with the literal meaning of the words. If they don't align, it's quite possible that the speaker is lying or at least unconvinced. [176]</p>
      <p><mark>There are actually three kinds of "Yes" Commitment, Confirmation, and Counterfeit. [177]</mark></p>
      <p>The Rule of Three is simply getting the other guy to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation. [177]</p>
      <p>On average, liars use more words than truth tellers and use far more third-person pronouns. They start talking about him, her, it, one, they, and their, rather than I, in order to put some distance between themselves and the lie. [178]</p>
      <p>Liars tend to speak in more complex sentences in an attempt to win over their suspicious counterparts. [178]</p>
      <p>People who are lying are, understandably, more worried about being believed, so they work harder-too hard, as it were--at being believable. [178]</p>
      <p>The more in love they are with "I" "me; and "my" the less important they are. [179]</p>
      <p>People are often tired of being hammered with their own name. The slick salesman trying to drive them to "Yes" will hit them with it over and over. [179]</p>
      <p>Using your own name creates the dynamic of "forced empathy." It makes the other side see you as a person. [180]</p>
      <p>The art of closing a deal is staying focused to the very end. [185]</p>
      <p>No part of a negotiation induces more anxiety and unfocused aggression than bargaining, which is why it's the part that is more often fumbled and mishandled than any other. [190]</p>
      <p><mark>People fall into three broad categories. Some people are Accommodators; others--like me-are basically Assertive; and the rest are data-loving Analysts. [192]</mark></p>
      <p>Blunt assertion is actually counter-productive most of the time. [193]</p>
      <p>There is one basic truth about a successful bargaining style: To be good, you have to learn to be yourself at the bargaining table. To be great you have to add to your strengths, not replace them. [193]</p>
      <p>ANALYSTS</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Analysts are methodical and diligent. They are not in a big rush. [193]</p>
        <p>People like this are skeptical by nature. So asking too many questions to start is a bad idea, because they're not going to want to answer until they understand all the implications. [194]</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>ACCOMMODATOR</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The most important thing to this type of negotiator is the time spent building the relationship. [194]</p>
        <p>Their goal is to be on great terms with their counterpart. They love the win-win. [195]</p>
        <p>They are very easy to talk to, extremely friendly, and have pleasant voices. They will yield a concession to appease or acquiesce and hope the other side reciprocates. [195]</p>
        <p>Due to their tendency to be the first to activate the reciprocity cycle, they may have agreed to give you something they can't actually deliver. [195]</p>
        <p>If you have identified yourself as an Accommodator, stick to your ability to be very likable, but do not sacrifice your objections. [195]</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>ASSERTIVE</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The Assertive type believes time is money; every wasted minute is a wasted dollar. Their self-image is linked to how many things they can get accomplished in a period of time. For them, getting the solution perfect isn't as important as getting it done. [196]</p>
        <p>Most of all, the assertive wants to be heard. And not only do they want to be heard, but they don't actually have the ability to listen to you until they know that you've heard them. They focus on their own goals rather than people. And they tell rather than ask. [196]</p>
        <p><mark>When you're dealing with Assertive types, it's best to focus on what they have to say, because once they are convinced you understand them, then and only then will they listen for your point of view. [196]</mark></p>
        <p>Mirrors are a wonderful tool with this type. [196]</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We've seen how each of these groups views the importance of time differently (time = preparation; time = relationship; time = money). [197]</p>
      <p>For an Accommodator type, silence is anger. [197]</p>
      <p>For Analysts, though, silence means they want to think. And Assertive types interpret your silence as either you don't have anything to say or you want them to talk. [197]</p>
      <p><mark>The greatest obstacle to accurately identifying someone else's style is what I call the "I am normal" paradox. That is, our hypothesis that the world should look to others as it looks to us. [197]</mark></p>
      <p>Experienced negotiators often lead with a ridiculous offer, an extreme anchor. [199]</p>
      <p>Successful negotiators often say "No" in one of the many ways we've talked about ("How am I supposed to accept that?") or deflect the anchor with questions like "What are we trying to accomplish here?" [199]</p>
      <p>"What else would you be able to offer to make that a good price for me?" [199]</p>
      <p><mark>If you feel you can't say "No" then you've taken yourself hostage. [204]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>In any bare-knuckle bargaining session, the most vital principle to keep in mind is never to look at your counterpart as an enemy. [204]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>The person across the table is never the problem. The unsolved issue is. So focus on the issue. [204]</mark></p>
      <p>The Ackerman model [206]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. Set your target price (your goal).</p>
        <p>2. Set your first offer at 65 percent of your target price.</p>
        <p>3. Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100 percent).</p>
        <p>4. Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying "No" to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer.</p>
        <p>5. When calculating the final amount, use precise, non-round numbers like, say, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight.</p>
        <p>6. On your final number, throw in a non-monetary item (that they probably don't want) to show you're at your limit. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Just like people are more likely to send Christmas cards to people who first send cards to them, they are more likely to make bargaining concessions to those who have made compromises in their direction. [207]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
      <p>Black Swan theory tells us that things happen that were previously thought to be impossible- or never thought of at all. This is not the same as saying that sometimes things happen against one-in-a-million odds, but rather that things never imagined do come to pass. [215]</p>
      <p>The Black Swan symbolizes the uselessness of predictions based on previous experience. Black Swans are events or pieces of knowledge that sit outside our regular expectations and therefore cannot be predicted. [216]</p>
      <p>In every negotiating session, there are different kinds of information. There are those things we know, like our counterpart's name and their offer and our experiences from other negotiations. Those are known knowns. There are those things we are certain that exist but we don't know, like the possibility that the other side might get sick and leave us with another counterpart. Those are known unknowns and they are like poker wild cards; you know they’re out there but you don't know who has them. But most important are those things we don't know that we don't know, pieces of information we've never imagined but that would be game changing if uncovered. Maybe our counterpart wants the deal to fail because he's leaving for a competitor. These unknown unknowns are Black Swans. [216]</p>
      <p><mark>The problem is that conventional questioning and research techniques are designed to confirm known knowns and reduce uncertainty. They don't dig into the unknown. [219]</mark></p>
      <p>It is the person best able to unearth, adapt to, and exploit the unknowns that will come out on top. [219]</p>
      <p>You have to feel for the truth behind the camouflage; you have to note the small pauses that suggest discomfort and lies. Don't look to verify what you expect. [219]</p>
      <p><mark>"Why are they communicating what they are communicating right now?" [220]</mark></p>
      <p>Negotiation is more like walking on a tightrope than competing against an opponent. Focusing so much on the end objective will only distract you from the next step. [220]</p>
      <p>Where does your counterpart want to gain and what do they fear losing? [220]</p>
      <p>It often doesn't matter what leverage actually exists against you; what really matters is the leverage they think you have on them. [221]</p>
      <p>As a negotiator you should always be aware of which side, at any given moment, feels they have the most to lose if negotiations collapse. [221]</p>
      <p>If you shove your negative leverage down your counterpart's throat, it might be perceived as you taking away their autonomy. People will often sooner die than give up their autonomy. [223]</p>
      <p>In any negotiation, but especially in a tense one like this, it's not how well you speak but how well you listen that determines your success. [225]</p>
      <p>“Paradox of power"-namely, the harder we push the more likely we are to be met with resistance. That's why you have to use negative leverage sparingly. [227]</p>
      <p>Review everything you hear. You will not hear everything the first time, so double-check. Compare notes with your team members. You will often discover new information that will help you advance the negotiation. Use backup listeners whose only job is to listen between the lines. They will hear things you miss. [228]</p>
      <p>We trust people more when we view them as being similar or familiar. [229]</p>
      <p>The moment when we're most ready to throw our hands up and declare "They're crazy!" is often the best moment for discovering Black Swans that transform a negotiation. [232]</p>
      <p>Often the other side is acting on bad information, and when people have bad information they make bad choices. [233]</p>
      <p>People operating with incomplete information appear crazy to those who have different information. [234]</p>
      <p>The presence of hidden interests isn't as rare as you might think. Your counterpart will often reject offers for reasons that have nothing to do with their merits. [235]</p>
      <p><mark>Black Swans are incredibly hard to uncover if you're not literally at the table. No matter how much research you do, there's just some information that you are not going to find out unless you sit face-to-face. [236]</mark></p>
      <p>During a typical business meeting, the first few minutes, before you actually get down to business, and the last few moments, as everyone is leaving, often tell you more about the other side than anything in between. [237]</p>
      <p>Remember, pushing hard for what you believe is not selfish. It is not bullying. It is not just helping you. Your amygdala, the part of the brain that processes fear, will try to convince you to give up, to flee, because the other guy is right, or you're being cruel. But if you are an honest, decent person looking for a reasonable outcome, you can ignore the amygdala. [243]</p>
      <p>Whether it's in the office or around the family dinner table, don't avoid honest, clear conflict. [243]</p>

      <p>People who set specific, challenging, but realistic goals end up getting better deals than those who don't set goals or simply strive to do their best. [253]</p>
