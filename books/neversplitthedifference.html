      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>I was employing what had become the FBI’s most potent negotiating tools: the open ended question. [p.3]</p>
      <p>We call this tactic calibrated questions: queries that the other side can respond to but that have no fixed answers. It buys you time. It gives your counterpart the illusion of control. [p.3]</p>
      <p>Our techniques were the product experiential learning; they were developed by agents in the field, negotiating through crisis and sharing stories of what succeeded and what failed. It was an iterative process, not an intellectual one. [p.4]</p>
      <p>All the raw intelligence and mathematical logic in the world is little help in the fraught, shifting interplay of two people negotiating. [p.8]</p>
      <p>Hostage taking - and therefore hostage negotiating - has existed since the dawn of recorded time. The Old Testament spins plenty of tales of Israelites and their enemies taking each other’s citizens hostage as spoils of war. The romans, for their part, used to force the princes of vassal states to send their sons to Rome from their education, to ensure the continued loyalty of the princes. [p.9]</p>
      <p>Their (Roger Fisher and William Ury - authors of getting to yes) core assumption was that the emotional brain - that animalistic, unreliable, and irrational beast - could be overcome through a more rational, joint problem-solving mindset. [p.11]</p>
      <p>Their system was easy to follow and seductive, with four basic tenants. One, separate the person - the emotion - from the problem; two don’t get wrapped up in the other side’s position (what they’re asking for) but instead focus on their interests (why they’re asking for it) so that you can find what they really want; three, work cooperatively to generate win-win options; and, four, establish mutually agreed-upon standards for evaluating those possible solutions. [p.11]</p>
      <p>“It is self-evident that people are neither fully rational nor completely selfish, and that their tastes are anything but stable.” - Daniel Kahenman [p.12]</p>
      <p>The framing effect, demonstrates that people respond differently to the same choice depending on how it is framed. [p.12]</p>
      <p>Prospect theory explains why we take unwarranted risks in the face of uncertain losses. [p.12]</p>
      <p>Loss aversion shows how people are statistically more likely to act to avert a loss than achieve an equal gain. [p.12]</p>
      <p><mark>“Man, he wrote, has two systems of thought: System 1, our animal mind, is fast, instinctive, and emotional; System 2 is slow, deliberative, and logical. And system 1 is far more influential. In fact, it guides and steers our rational thoughts”</mark> - Kahneman [p.12]</p>
      <p><mark>We react emotionally (system 1) to a suggestion or question. Then that system 1 reaction informs and in effect creates the system 2 answer.</mark> [p.12]</p>
      <p>If you know how to affect your counterpart’s system 1 thinking, his inarticulate feelings, by how you frame and deliver your questions and statements, then you can guide his system 2 rationality and therefore modify his responses. [p.12-13]</p>
      <p>Hostage negotiations were (are) anything but rational problem-solving situations. [p.13]</p>
      <p>Have you ever tried to devise a mutually beneficial win-win solution with a guy who thinks he’s the messiah? It was becoming glaringly obvious the Getting To Yes didn’t work with kidnappers. [p.14]</p>
      <p>If emotionally driven incidents, not rational bargaining interactions, constituted the bulk of what most police negotiators had to deal with, then our negotiating skills had to laser-focus on the animal, emotional, and irrational. [p.15]</p>
      <p><mark>People want to be understood and accepted. Listening is the cheapest, yet most effective concession we can make to get there. [p.16]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>Contrary to popular opinion, listening is not a passive activity It is the most active thing you can do. [p.16]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>Life is negotiation. The majority of the interactions we have at work and at home are negotiations that boil down to the expression of a simple, animalistic urge: I want. [p.17]</mark></p>
      <p>Negotiating is not browbeating or grinding someone down. It simply means playing the emotional game that human society is set up for. [p.18]</p>
      <p><mark>It’s vitally important to get to, “No”, because “No” starts the negotiation. [p.20]</mark></p>
      <p>Queries that begin with “How?” Or “What?” By eliminating “Yes” and “No” answers (they) force your counterpart to apply their mental energy to solving your problems. [p.20]</p>
      <p>To successfully negotiate it is critical to prepare. [p.21]</p>
      <p>Negotiation is the heart of collaboration It is what makes conflicts potentially meaningful and productive for all parties. [p.21]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>Good negotiators, going in, know they have to be ready for possible surprises; great negotiators aim to use their skills to reveal the surprises they are certain exist. [p.24]</p>
      <p>In negotiation, each new phycological insight or additional piece of information revealed heralds a step forward and allows one to discard on hypothesis in favor of another. You should engage the process with a mindset of discovery. [p.25]</p>
      <p><mark>Your goal at the outset is to extract and observe as much information as possible. [p.25]</mark></p>
      <p>Too often people find it easier just to stick with what they believe. [p.25]</p>
      <p>They often make assumptions about others even before meeting them. [p.25]</p>
      <p>Be aware of a counterpart’s overuse of personal pronouns – we/they/ or me/I. The less important he makes himself, the more important he probably is (and vice versa). [p.25-26]</p>
      <p>Until you know what you’re dealing with, you don’t know what you’re dealing with. [p.26]</p>
      <p>It’s really not that easy to listen well. [p.27]</p>
      <p>For those people who view negotiation as a battle of arguments, it’s the voices in their own head that are overwhelming them. When they’re not talking, they’re thinking about their arguments, and when they are talking, they’re making their arguments. [p.28]</p>
      <p><mark>Instead of prioritizing your argument – in face, instead of doing any thinking at all in the early goings about what you’re going to say – make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say. [p.28]</mark></p>
      <p>The goal is to identify what your counterparts actually need (monetarily, emotionally, or otherwise) and get them feeling safe enough to talk and talk and talk some more about what they want. The latter will help you discover the former. [p.28]</p>
      <p><mark>Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making. If we’re too much in a hurry, people can feel as if they’re not being heard and we risk undermining the rapport and trustee’ve built. [p.30]</mark></p>
      <p>When you slow the process down, you also calm it down. [p.30]</p>
