      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>I was employing what had become the FBI’s most potent negotiating tools: the open ended question. [p.3]</p>
      <p>We call this tactic calibrated questions: queries that the other side can respond to but that have no fixed answers. It buys you time. It gives your counterpart the illusion of control. [p.3]</p>
      <p>Our techniques were the product experiential learning; they were developed by agents in the field, negotiating through crisis and sharing stories of what succeeded and what failed. It was an iterative process, not an intellectual one. [p.4]</p>
      <p>All the raw intelligence and mathematical logic in the world is little help in the fraught, shifting interplay of two people negotiating. [p.8]</p>
      <p>Hostage taking - and therefore hostage negotiating - has existed since the dawn of recorded time. The Old Testament spins plenty of tales of Israelites and their enemies taking each other’s citizens hostage as spoils of war. The romans, for their part, used to force the princes of vassal states to send their sons to Rome from their education, to ensure the continued loyalty of the princes. [p.9]</p>
      <p>Their (Roger Fisher and William Ury - authors of getting to yes) core assumption was that the emotional brain - that animalistic, unreliable, and irrational beast - could be overcome through a more rational, joint problem-solving mindset. [p.11]</p>
      <p>Their system was easy to follow and seductive, with four basic tenants. One, separate the person - the emotion - from the problem; two don’t get wrapped up in the other side’s position (what they’re asking for) but instead focus on their interests (why they’re asking for it) so that you can find what they really want; three, work cooperatively to generate win-win options; and, four, establish mutually agreed-upon standards for evaluating those possible solutions. [p.11]</p>
      <p>“It is self-evident that people are neither fully rational nor completely selfish, and that their tastes are anything but stable.” - Daniel Kahenman [p.12]</p>
      <p>The framing effect, demonstrates that people respond differently to the same choice depending on how it is framed. [p.12]</p>
      <p>Prospect theory explains why we take unwarranted risks in the face of uncertain losses. [p.12]</p>
      <p>Loss aversion shows how people are statistically more likely to act to avert a loss than achieve an equal gain. [p.12]</p>
      <p><mark>“Man, he wrote, has two systems of thought: System 1, our animal mind, is fast, instinctive, and emotional; System 2 is slow, deliberative, and logical. And system 1 is far more influential. In fact, it guides and steers our rational thoughts”</mark> - Kahneman [p.12]</p>
      <p><mark>We react emotionally (system 1) to a suggestion or question. Then that system 1 reaction informs and in effect creates the system 2 answer.</mark> [p.12]</p>
      <p>If you know how to affect your counterpart’s system 1 thinking, his inarticulate feelings, by how you frame and deliver your questions and statements, then you can guide his system 2 rationality and therefore modify his responses. [p.12-13]</p>
      <p>Hostage negotiations were (are) anything but rational problem-solving situations. [p.13]</p>
