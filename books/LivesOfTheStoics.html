      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>There was no other purpose to reading and study if not to live a happy life. [ix]</p>
      <p>Courage. Temperance. Justice. Wisdom. [x]</p>
      <p>Cicero once said that to philosophize is to learn how to die. [x]</p>
      <p>If philosophy is anything, it's an answer to that question- how to live. [xiv]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Zeno The Prophet</h2>
        <p>To Zeno, the purpose of philosophy, of virtue, was to find "a smooth flow of life. [6]</p>
        <p>Those who live by keeping the individual and universal natures in agreement are happy. [6]</p>
        <p>Zeno believed that conceitedness was the primary obstacle to learning. [8]</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>Cleanthes The Apostle</h2>
        <p>Long after Cleanthes had made a name for himself as a budding philosopher, he kept at his manual labors, studying hard during the day and working harder at night. [14]</p>
        <p>To Cleanthes, labor and philosophy were not rivals. They were two sides of the same coin, pursuits that furthered and enabled each other. [15]</p>
        <p>Anything you do well is noble, no matter how humble. [15]</p>
        <p><mark>Philoponia – a love of work. Literally, a marrow-deep dedication to honest labor. Not just for money, of course, but also to improve himself. [15]</mark></p>
        <p>While other schools debated behind closed walls or doors, the Stoics had taken philosophy to the streets. This gave them greater impact and almost made them targets. [20]</p>
        <p>That is to say that one's self-talk must be strict, but never abusive. [21]</p>
        <p><mark>"Fate guides the man who's willing," he writes in one short fragment, "drags the unwilling." [23]</mark></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Aristo The Challenger</h2>
        <p>There is no such thing as a movement without disagreement, after all, and nothing that involves people does not also involve differing opinions. Stoicism is no exception. [27]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Chrysippus The Fighter</h2>
        <p>"Runners in a race ought to compete and strive to win as hard as they can," Chrysippus would later say, "but by no means should they trip their competitors or give them a shove. So too in life; it is not wrong to seek after the things useful in life; but to do so while depriving someone else is not just." [40]</p>
        <p>Let no one think that ideas that change the world do so on their own. They must, as a wise scientist would later say, be shoved down people's throats. Or at least defended and fought for. [42]</p>
        <p>There is sometimes no better way to strengthen your defense than to learn your opponent's offense, and this is precisely what a good philosopher does. [43]</p>
        <p>He was once criticized for not joining a throng that attended Aristo's lectures, to which he simply replied that "if I had cared about the mob, I would not have studied philosophy." [46]</p>
        <p>There is no better definition of a Stoic: to have but not want, to enjoy without needing. [46]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Zeno The Maintainer</h2>
        <p>One of the central beliefs of Stoicism is the idea that history is cyclical. That the same thing happens again and again and again. [51]</p>
        <p><mark>We are interchangeable pieces, role players in a play that has been playing since the beginning of time. [51]</mark></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Diogenes The Diplomat</h2>
        <p>It's not what you say that lives on after your time; it's not what you write or even what you build. It's the example that you set. It's the things that you live by. [57]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Antipater The Ethicist</h2>
        <p><mark>The human being in action is better understood as an archer. We train and practice. We draw back the arrow and aim it to the best of our abilities. But we know full well that despite our training and our aim, many factors outside our control will influence where the arrow hits the target-or if it falls short entirely. [68-69]</mark></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Panaetius The Connector</h2>
        <p>Learn. Apply. Learn. Apply. Learn. Apply. This is the Stoic way. [76]</p>
        <p><mark>It is in the balance, the integrating of competing obligations and interests and talents that the good life is found and lived. [85]</mark></p>
        <p>Suppose your son dies, he said. You must remind yourself that you knew he was mortal when you brought him into the world. The same is true for friends, he would have had to reassure himself. The same is true for careers. [85]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Publius Rutilius Rufus</h2>
        <p><mark>Politics is a dirty business. It is now and it was then. In Rome, as in the modern world, power attracts ego. It corrupts. It rewards vanity. It disincentivizes responsibility. It is filled, and always will be filled, with liars, cheats, demagogues, and cowards. [89]</mark></p>
        <p>You must be prepared at all times for the unexpected blows of life. [94]</p>
        <p>When the state is beyond redemption and helplessly corrupt, the Stoics believed, the wise man will stay away. [94-95]</p>
        <p>There is a cost to cheating, to stealing, to doing the wrong thing- even if society rewards it. [95]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Posidonius The Genius</h2>
        <p>The abundance of Svria in those days made its people "free from the bother of the necessities of life, and so were forever meeting for a continual life of feasting and their gymnasia turned into baths." He wrote of the "drunken ambition" of the local tyrants. Things were good, but good times rarely make for great people, or great governments. [99]</p>
        <p>From the peaceful passing of a philosopher like Antipater, who had spent his final moments counting the blessings of his voyage through life. [102]</p>
        <p><mark>It's a timeless question: If you actually knew what "success” and "power” looked like–what it did to the people who got it–would you still want it? [102]</mark></p>
        <p>Be wary of ambition. Avoid the mob. Luxury, as much as power, rots. [103]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Diotimus The Vicious</h2>
        <p>"If it is not right, do not do it," Marcus Aurelius would write in his encapsulation of Stoic doctrine, "if it is not true, do not say it." [110]</p>
        <p><mark>When we are angry, it's almost always better to wait and do nothing. And as far as our enemies go, if possible, we ought to let them destroy themselves. [111]</mark></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Cicero The Fellow Traveler</h2>
        <p>"If you have a garden and a library," Cicero would write in a letter to a friend as they discussed Chrysippus and Diodotus, "you have everything you need." Clearly there was a part of him that didn't fully believe that, that could not be content with the simple or the reflective life. Like many people, he seemed to believe that he needed wealth and fame too. Like many of us who crave those same things, he did not quite realize what they would cost him until he got them... and by then it was too late. [121]</p>
        <p>Cicero once wrote that the beginnings of things are small. He would also find in those few short years that the ends of things are surprising and fast. [126]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Cato The Younger, Rome’s Iron Man</h2>
        <p>Life is not fair and it cares little for our feelings or our plans. [139]</p>
        <p>Powerful people were hostile to Cato nearly all his life, because his very essence seemed to shame them. [140]</p>
        <p>He rejected the extravagant, brilliantly colored purple robes that were fashionable in the Senate and wore only a plain, ordinary dark robe. He never put on perfume. He walked Rome's streets barefoot and wore nothing underneath his toga. While his friends rode horses, he declined, and enjoyed walking alongside them. He never left Rome while the Senate was in session. He threw no lavish parties and declined to gorge himself at feasts — and was strict about reserving the choicest portions for others. He lent his friends money without interest. He declined armed guards or an entourage, and in the army he slept in the trenches with his troops. [141]</p>
        <p>We naturally care what people think of us; we don't want to seem too different, so we acquire the same tastes as everyone else. We accept what the crowd does so the crowd will accept us. But in doing this, we weaken ourselves. We compromise, often without knowing it; we allow ourselves to be bought —without even the benefit of getting paid for it. [141]</p>
        <p>A Stoic does the job that needs to be done. They don't care about credit. [148]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Porcia Cato The Iron Woman </h2>
        <p>For nothing racks the nerves quite like the moments, as Shakespeare would say, between decision and action. [157]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Athenodorus Cananites The Kingmaker</h2>
        <p>At the core of Stoicism is the acceptance of what we cannot change. [163]</p>
        <p>Renting a large mansion in Athens that was purported to be haunted, Athenodorus, undaunted by the stories, set about putting his house in order. Almost immediately, he said, he was visited by a ghost clapped in irons and dragging heavy chains. Not to be disturbed from his writing session, Athenodorus motioned for the ghost to wait and returned to his work. When he finished, he got up and followed the apparition into the court-yard, where it suddenly vanished. Thinking fast, Athenodorus marked the spot where the ghost disappeared and then returned to tidy up his desk and go to bed. In the morning, he had workers return to the spot and ordered them to dig. Beneath the dirt they found ancient bones in chains, which Athenodorus had reburied with honors in a public funeral. The ghost was never seen again, by him or any other resident of the house. Whether one believed in ghosts or the supernatural, as Octavian likely did, was beside the point. Stoics must always keep their head. Even the scariest situations can be resolved with reason and courage. And even if you believe in silly things like ghosts or superstitions, you can't let your life be ruled by them. You must be in charge —no excuses. [164-165]</p>
        <p>"Whenever you feel yourself getting angry, Caesar," he instructed, "don't say or do anything until you've repeated the twenty-four letters of the alphabet to yourself." Good advice for the ordinary. Essential for an emperor. And sadly ignored by leaders of all types —to the detriment of those who depend on and work with them." [166]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Aries Didymus The Kingmaker II</h2>
        <p>The Stoics would have never argued that life was fair or that losing someone didn't hurt. But they believed that to despair, to tear ourselves apart in bereavement, was not only an affront to the memory of the person we loved, but a betrayal of the living who still needed us. [172]</p>
        <p>The four cardinal virtues: wisdom (phronesis), self-control (sophrosune),justice (dikaiosune), and bravery (andreia) [172]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Seneca The Striver</h2>
        <p><mark>It's a credit to Seneca's father, and a reminder to fathers since, that he patiently indulged this period and encouraged a range of study for his son. It can take a while for precocious young people to find themselves, and forcing them to curtail their curiosity is expedient but often costly. [187]</mark></p>
        <p><mark>We should never underestimate fortune's habit of behaving just as she pleases. Just because we have worked hard, just because we are showing promise and our path toward success is clear has no bearing on whether we will get what we want. [188]</mark></p>
        <p>A man must realize how little he needs to be happy. [199]</p>
        <p>He had enjoyed the good times too. He had not complained, he kept going, kept serving, kept trying to have impact and to do what he had been trained to do. What he had never done was stop and question any of it, never asked where this was leading him and whether it was worth it. [200]</p>
        <p>A warning against the draws of power and the unspeakable things human beings do to each other in the pursuit of it. [204]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Gaius Rebellious Plautus - The Man Who Would Not Be King</h2>
        <p>Cicero popularized the story of the "Sword of Damocles" —the threat of death and uprising —that intimidated all kings. [215]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Thrasea The Fearless</h2>
        <p>As Seneca had warned him, crimes return upon those who commit them, and no one can murder or kill enough to make themselves invincible. [225]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Helvidius Priscus The Senator</h2>
        <p>Fortune does that, Seneca had written, brings us low, as well as proud. Breaks our hearts as well as gives us lucky breaks. What matters is what we do with either one. [230]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Musonius Rufus The Unbreakable</h2>
        <p>As bad as exile — or any adversity —is, it can make you better, if you so choose. [242]</p>
        <p><mark>"Do not be irked by difficult circumstances," he once said, "but reflect on how many things have already happened to you in life in ways that you did not wish, and yet they have turned out for the best. [246]</mark></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Epictetus The Freeman </h2>
        <p>The rich in Rome were no different than the rich today: Despite all their wealth, ambition turns even a powerful person into a supplicant in the hope of gaining more. [254]</p>
        <p>"It is better to starve to death in a calm and confident state of mind," he would say, "than to live anxiously amidst abundance. [254-255]</p>
        <p>It is essential that we not respond impulsively to impressions; take a moment before reacting, and you will find it easier to maintain control. [259]</p>
        <p>The ability to accept life on life's terms, the need to not need things to be different, this was power to Epictetus. [260]</p>
        <p>You can only lose what you have. You don't control your possessions, so don't ascribe more value to them than they deserve. [261-262]</p>
        <p>It's impossible to begin to learn that which one thinks they already know, [263]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Junius Rustic’s The Dutiful </h2>
        <p><mark>You owe it to yourself and to the world to actively engage with the brief moment you have on this planet. You cannot retreat exclusively into ideas. You must contribute. [270] </mark></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Marcus Aurelius There Philosopher King </h2>
        <p>Reservations are not the same thing as cowardice. The most confident leaders-the best ones-often are worried that they won't do a good enough job. They go into the job knowing it will not be an easy one. But they do proceed. [281]</p>
        <p>Marcus believed that plagues and war could only threaten our life. What we need to protect is our character-how we act within these wars and plagues and life's other setbacks. And to abandon character? That's real evil. [283]</p>
        <p>It's only in our modern reactionary, divisive focus on "privilege" that we have forgotten how much we all have in common as human beings, how we all stand equally naked and defenseless against fate whether we possess worldly power or not. [283]</p>
        <p>Do the right thing. The rest doesn't matter. [285]</p>
        <p>Whenever you have trouble getting up in the morning, remind yourself that you've been made by nature for the purpose of working with others. [290]</p>
        <p>At first glance it looks like the head has been broken off. But a closer inspection reveals that the head was designed to be replaceable. The statue was part of a shrine for the cult of the emperor, and they wanted to be able to swap the head out each time a new one took the throne. [291]</p>
        <p><mark>“As if the world would notice." [291]</mark></p>
        <p>You must build up your life action by action, and be content if each one achieves its goal as far as possible-and no one can keep you from this. [293]</p>
        <p>Instead of holding them to his standards or expecting the impossible—as many talented, brilliant leaders naturally do—he focused on their strengths and was tolerant of their weaknesses. [293]</p>
        <p>Marcus may have lived humbly, but no one could say he was not generous to others. [296]</p>
        <p>Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself. [296]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion </h2>
        <p>"Is it possible to be free from error? Not by any means, but it is possible to be a person stretching to avoid error." That's what Stoicism is. It's stretching. Training. To be better. To get better. To avoid one more mistake, to take one step closer toward that ideal. Not perfection, but progress—that's what each of these lives was about. [307]</p>
