      <p>I recognized even as a 9-year old that I had a lot of choices and my decisions mattered. What I did each day would determine the kind of person I’d become. [p.4]</p>
      <p>Determined as I was to be ready, just incase I ever got to go to space, I was equally determined to enjoy myself. [p.5]</p>
      <p>Since the odds of becoming an astronaut were nonexistent, I knew it would be pretty silly to hang my sense of self-worth on it. My attitude was more, “Its probably not going to happen, but I should do things that keep me moving in the right direction, just in case–and I should be sure those things interested me, so that whatever happens, I’m happy.” [p.6]</p>
      <p><mark>As I have discovered again and again, things are never as bad (or as good) as it seems at the time.</mark> [p.10]</p>
      <p>The most important thing you need to change? Your mind. You need to learn to think like an astronaut. [p.19]</p>
