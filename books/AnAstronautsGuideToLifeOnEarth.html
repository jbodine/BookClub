      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>I recognized even as a 9-year old that I had a lot of choices and my decisions mattered. What I did each day would determine the kind of person I’d become. [p.4]</p>
      <p>Determined as I was to be ready, just incase I ever got to go to space, I was equally determined to enjoy myself. [p.5]</p>
      <p>Since the odds of becoming an astronaut were nonexistent, I knew it would be pretty silly to hang my sense of self-worth on it. My attitude was more, “Its probably not going to happen, but I should do things that keep me moving in the right direction, just in case–and I should be sure those things interested me, so that whatever happens, I’m happy.” [p.6]</p>
      <p><mark>As I have discovered again and again, things are never as bad (or as good) as it seems at the time.</mark> [p.10]</p>
      <p>The most important thing you need to change? Your mind. You need to learn to think like an astronaut. [p.19]</p>
      <p>In the van, we can see the rocket in the distance, lit up and shinning, an obelisk. In reality, of course, it’s a 4.5-megaton bomb loaded with explosive fuel, which is why everyone else is driving away from it. [p.24]</p>
      <p><mark>I hadn’t been able to separate out the vital from the trivial, to differentiate between what was going to keep me alive in an emergency and what was esoteric and interesting, but not crucial. [p.28]</mark></p>
      <p>The job description is not to experience yet-haw personal thrills in space, but to help make space exploration safer and more scientifically productive – not for ourselves but for others. [p.29]</p>
      <p>I knew something about myself: it takes me longer to understand when the culture is not my own, so I have to consciously resist the urge to hurry things along and push my own expectations on others. [p.33]</p>
      <p>Astronauts are taught that the best way to reduce stress is to sweat the small stuff. We’re trained to look on the dark side and to imagine the worst things that could possibly happen. In fact, in simulators, one of the most common questions we learn to ask ourselves is, “Okay, what’s the next thing that will kill me?” [p.36]</p>
      <p>The upshot of all this is that we become competent, which is the most important quality to have if you’re an astronaut – or frankly, anyone, anywhere, who is striving to succeed at anything at all. [p.36]</p>
      <p>Competence means keeping your head in a crisis, sticking with a task even when it seems hopeless, and improvising good passes ingenuity, determination and being prepared for anything. [p.36] </p>
      <p>Astronauts have these qualities not because we’re smarter than everyone else (though let’s face it, you do need a certain amount of intellectual horsepower to be able to fix a toilet). It’s because we are taught to view the world – and ourselves – different. [p.36]</p>
