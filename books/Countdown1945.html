      <p>Man is a creature whose substance is faith. What his faith is, he is. [15]</p>

        <p>The report concluded: "Atomic energy if controlled by the major peace-loving nations, should insure the peace of the world for decades to come. If misused it can lead our civilization to annihilation.” [49]</p>

        <p>I thought of Carthage, Baalbec (sic), Jerusalem, Rome, Atlanta, Be. king Babylon, Ninevah, - Scipio, Ramses I ... Sherman,Jerghis Khan, Aesander... I hope for some sort of peace–but I fear that machines are ahead of morals by some centuries and when morals catch up there'll be no reason for any of it. [123]</p>
        <p><mark>In the control bunker, Kistiakowsky said, "I am sure that at the end of the world- in the last milli-second of the earth's existence, the last man will see what we saw." [132]</mark></p>

        <p>Oppenheimer's monster was almost loose, Unlike Dr. Frankenstein, there was no way to destroy it now. He could only try to contain the damage. [167]</p>

        <h2>1 Day</h2>
        <p>"If we crack up and the plane catches fire, there is danger of an atomic explosion that could wipe out half this island" Parsons told the other officers. Farrell winced. "I pray that won't happen, he muttered. Parsons suggested more than prayers. He volunteered to arm the weapons trigger after takeoff, inserting one of the uranium slugs and the explosive charges into the bomb casing while the plane was en route to Hiroshima. If the plane crashed on takeoff, they'd lose only the crew and the airplane, not the bomb or the island. [203]</p>
        <p>We now have within our grasp the control of fundamental forces of the universe that could lead us to a millennium of good or to the destruction of civilization. [211]</p>

        <p>He spelled out the rules for a successful mission in a few crisp sentences: Do your jobs. Obey your orders. Don't cut corners or take chances. [214]</p>

        <p>Jeppson headed back into the bomb bay, alone this time. He clambered down alongside the bomb, removed three green safety plugs, and replaced them with red ones, activating the bomb's internal batteries. "Its live, he said to the intercom. [223]</p>

        <h2>Firestorm</h2>
        <p>War, the scourge of human race since time began, now held terrors beyond belief. [229]</p>
        <p>It was no longer smoke, or dust, or even a cloud of fire. It was a living thing, a new species of being, born right before our incredulous eyes. [244]</p>

        <p>I realize the tragic significance of the atomic bomb, the president aid. "We have used it against those who attacked us without waring, a Pearl Harbor, against those who have starved and beaten and executed American prisoners of war, against those who have abandoned all pretense of obeying international laws of warfare.

        <h2>Epilogue</h2>
        <p>There is no doubt that [the atomic bomb] is, in its potentialities, the most significant event in the history of mankind for many generations. At least it seems literally true that humanity as a whole must either learn to live at peace or face destruction on a grotesquely vast scale. [248-249]</p>
        <p>In 1949, Russia tested a nuclear device. A new national security doctrine took hold- Mutual Assured Destruction, or MAD. [253]</p>
        <p>The stockpile of nuclear bombs and warheads on our planet-each one vastly more powerful than Little Boy and Fat Man- is now almost 50,000- equivalent to several million Hiroshima explosions. But seventy-five years later, only one nation has ever used the weapon in war. The United States. [256]</p>

        <h2>Postscript</h2>
        <p>I think we were all very elated that it worked, Lilli said late in her life. But we all carry around some guilt. A lot of people were killed. It's all difficult in a way. You do feel guilt for all those lives, but of course, the real trouble is war. It isn't the weapons you use. [267]</p>
        <p><mark>We were fighting an enemy that had a reputation for never surrendering, never accepting defeat, he said. It's really hard to talk about morality and war in the same sentence. [272]</mark></p>
        <p>Humane warfare is an oxymoron. War by definition is barbaric. To try and distinguish between an acceptable method of killing and an unacceptable method is ludicrous. [272]</p>
        <p>Deterrence, up until now, has worked. It cannot continue forever. [273]</p>
