      <h2>Preface</h2>
      <p>Perfectionism makes essential projects hard to start, self-doubt makes them hard to finish, and trying to do too much, too fast, makes it hard to sustain momentum. [16-17]</p>
      <p>Whenever your efforts yield a one-time benefit, you are getting a linear result. Every day you start from zero; if you don't put in the effort today then you don't get the result today. [17]</p>
      <p>With residual results you put in the effort once and reap the benefits again and again. [17]</p>
      <p>“What do we live for, if not to make life less difficult for each other?" - George Eliot. [19]</p>
      <p>Our brains are programmed to prioritize emotions with high "affective value"- like fear, resentment, or anger-these strong emotions will generally win out, leaving us with even fewer mental resources to devote to making progress on the things that matter. [24]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>When faced with a task that felt impossibly hard, she would ask, "Is there an easier way?" [28]</p>
      <p>I had overthought it. I'd over engineered it. I'd tried too hard. And as a result, I'd snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. Here is what I learned: trying too hard makes it harder to get the results you want. [32]</p>
      <p>To invert means to turn an assumption or approach upside down, to work backward, to ask, "What if the opposite were true?" Inversion can help you discover obvious insights you have missed because you're looking at the problem from only one point of view. It can highlight errors in our thinking. It can open our minds to new ways of doing things. [32]</p>
      <p>Assuming that all worthwhile things take enormous effort is one way of looking at a problem. For many overachievers it's the only way. They have learned how to solve problems even when exhausted or overwhelmed. They are good at getting things done by powering through. [32]</p>
      <p>When we feel overwhelmed, it may not be because the situation is inherently overwhelming. It may be because we are overcomplicating something in our own heads. Asking the question "What if this could be easy?" is a way to reset our thinking. [33]</p>
      <p>Part of the business strategy is to solve the simplest, easiest, and most valuable problem. [36]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>There are many experiences in our work and personal life that are boring, mundane, or even stressful. We often feel that we have no options but to endure them or avoid them, Culberson says. But if we can break down the processes into those steps, we may find ways to make the steps more bearable, or better yet, fun. [47]</p>
      <p>When Beethoven prepared his coffee each morning, he would count, one by one, exactly sixty beans for his cup. How the ancient Romans in the time of Caesar, prone to devise a ritual for almost every aspect of daily life, made a religious ceremony of their first shave-the depositio barbae. No matter how silly these behaviors may seem on the surface, doing them consistently can ground us, sooth our anxieties, and return us to an Effortless State in ways that are often understandable only to us. [51]</p>
      <p>When we invite joy into our daily routine, we are no longer yearning for the far-off day when it might arrive. That day is always today. [52]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p>Do you have any items like this, living rent-free in your mind? Outdated goals, suggestions, or ideas that snuck into your brain long ago and took up permanent residence? Mindsets that have outlived their usefulness but have been part of you for so long, you barely even notice them? [54]</p>
      <p>To create a new habit we simply need to look for something we already do and then attach a new behavior to it. He calls this a habit recipe, the simplest version of which is: After [X] I will [y). [61]</p>
      <p>As long as we have someone to blame, we don't have to take responsibility for our anger. [64]</p>
      <p>“When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time" said Maya Angelou [66]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      <p>To maximize gains from long-term practice, the study's lead author, K. Anders Ericsson, concluded, individuals must avoid exhaustion and must limit practice to an amount from which they can completely recover on a daily or weekly basis. [70]</p>
      <p><mark>Try this simple rule: Do not do more today than you can completely recover from today. Do not do more this week than you can completely recover from this week. [70-71]</mark></p>
      <p>The easier way is to replenish our physical and mental energy continuously by taking short breaks. We can plan those breaks into our day. [71]</p>
      <p>When we are struggling, instead of doubling down on our efforts, we might consider pausing the action-even for one minute. We don't need to fight these natural rhythms. We can flow with them. We can use them to our advantage. We can alternate between periods of exertion and renewal. [72]</p>
      <p>Getting more sleep may be the single greatest gift we can give our bodies, our minds, and even, it turns out, our bottom lines. [73]</p>
      <p>Sleep quality, on the other hand, is how much uninterrupted sleep you get overall. Uninterrupted sleep is when our brain waves and heart rate reach a point that allows physiological and psychological resources to be restored. This is why we rarely feel rested when we wake up a number of times at night. [74-75]</p>
      <p><mark>When we end our war on our body's natural rhythms, when we let others pass us in the un-winnable race for the most achieved with the least rest, our lives gain texture, clarity, and intention. We return to our Effortless State. [78]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      <p>Listening isn't hard; it's stopping our mind from wandering that's hard. [81]</p>
      <p>The greatest gift we can offer to others is not our skill or our money or our effort. It is simply us. None of us have infinite reserves of focus and attention to give away. [88]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. Prepare Your Space (two minutes) Find a quiet place. Turn off your phone. Let people know you will be taking ten minutes. Take a moment to clear off your desk. To put things back in their proper place.</p>
        <p>2. Rest Your Body (two minutes) Sit comfortably with your back straight. Close your eyes. Roll your shoulders. Move your head from side to side. Release ten- sion in every part of your body. Breathe normally and naturally.</p>
        <p>3. Relax Your Mind (two minutes) It's natural for your mind to be full of thoughts. Just acknowledge them. Notice them. Let them come and let them go.</p>
        <p>4. Release Your Heart (two minutes) If thoughts of someone who has wronged you arise, say, "I forgive you," and imagine you are cutting a chain that tethers you to them.</p>
        <p>5. Breathe in Gratitude (two minutes) Relive a moment in your life that you are really thankful for. Experience it again, using all of your senses. Remember where you were, how you felt, and who you were with. Really breathe the gratitude in. Repeat this step three times. [88-89]</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Past a certain point, more effort doesn't produce better performance. It sabotages our performance. [95]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
      <p>If you want to make something hard, indeed truly impossible, to complete, all you have to do is make the end goal as vague as possible. That's because you cannot, by definition, complete a project without a clearly defined end point. [101]</p>
      <p>I define "done" as the point just before the effort invested begins to be greater than the output achieved. To avoid diminishing returns on your time and effort, establish clear conditions for what "done" looks like, get there, then stop. [102]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
      <p>In recent years neuroscientists and psychologists have found that the "now" we experience lasts only 2.5 seconds. This is our psychological present. [112]</p>
      <p>When we're struggling to name the first obvious action, we need to either make it a little easier to get started on what's important now or make it a little harder to do something trivial instead. [113]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
      <p>We took a step back and asked, "What are the minimum steps required to complete this?" [118]</p>
      <p>I stepped to the table and, as politely as I could in front of his team, switched off the projector. After a long moment of awkward silence, I simply said, Let's just talk about your business! [121]</p>
      <p><mark>His team had been looking at their process the wrong way. They had started with an immensely complicated product and attempted to pare it down. But Jobs came at it from the opposite angle. He started at zero and tried to figure out the absolute minimum number of steps required to achieve the desired outcome. [122]</mark></p>
      <p>For each nonessential step removed, we gain more time, energy, and cognitive resources to put toward what's essential. [124]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
      <p>His most brilliant insight wasn't some advanced breakthrough in the science of flight. It was simply that focusing on the elegance and sophistication of the aircraft was actually an impediment to progress. An ugly aircraft that could be crashed, repaired, and redesigned fast would make it much easier to make progress on what really mattered. [127]</p>
      <p><mark>Every one of Pixar's stories starts out that way? Their earliest sketches are, according to Catmull, awkward and unformed, vulnerable and incomplete.? This is why Catmull has always worked hard to foster a culture that creates space for such "rubbish” [127]</mark></p>
      <p>To make effortless progress on what matters, learning-sized mistakes must be encouraged. This isn't giving yourself (or others) permission to consistently produce poor quality work; it's simply letting go of the absurd pressure to always do everything perfectly. [130]</p>
      <p><mark>A life spent in making mistakes is not only more honorable but more useful than a life spent doing nothing. [131]</mark></p>
      <p>The idea with the zero draft is to write anything. The more rubbish the better. It doesn't have to be seen by anyone. It never has to be judged. [131]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
      <p>“If you look closely at how elite infantry move, it looks like this: somewhere between a walk and a run, underscored by quick but careful footfalls, with weapons raised while rhythmically scanning the battlefield in all directions”. Less experienced infantry, he says, “will often zealously sprint into battle and give the impression of momentum. The problem with this approach is that as soon as they are in danger they will have to sprint to take cover at the first chance they get, and may end up in a place they haven't had time to survey or assess…” "Like the proverbial hare, this cycle of sprint-and-recover may seem fast in the moment, but long-term progress through the environment is slow and plagued by unidentified threats." [139]</p>
      <p><mark>We can establish upper and lower bounds. Simply use the following rule: Never less than X, never more than Y. [140]</mark></p>
    </section>

      <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
      <p>"The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing." Jim Collins famously favored the hedgehog's approach to succeeding in the business world, arguing that foxes lack focus and waste their energy. But Archilochus's comparison was always meant to suggest that the fox would fare better if it didn't simply know many things but knew how to connect those things together. [161]</p>
      <p>The best new ideas usually come from combining existing knowledge in one field with an "intrusion of unusual combinations" from other disciplines. [162]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
      <p>Whenever we want a far-reaching impact, teaching others to teach can be a high-leverage strategy. [170]</p>
      <p>If you try to teach people everything about everything, you run the risk of teaching them nothing. You will achieve residual results faster if you clearly identify-then simplify-the most important messages you want to teach others to teach. [173]</p>
      <p>Don't go for the overly sophisticated message. Don't go for the one that makes you sound smart. Go for the straightforward message that can be easily understood and repeated. [173]</p>
      <p><mark>Make the most essential things the easiest ones to teach and the easiest ones to learn. [173]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
      <p>When you have low trust on teams, everything is hard. Just sending a text or an email is exhausting as you weigh up every word for how it might be taken. When the response comes back you may experience a jolt of anxiety. Every conversation feels like it's a grind. When you don't trust that someone will deliver, you will feel you need to check up on them: remind them of deadlines, hover over them, review their work. Or you won't delegate anything at all, assuming you're better off just doing it yourself. The work can start to stall altogether. [187]</p>
      <p><mark>You can't have a high-performing team without high levels of trust. [187]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>When you can say these four little words, "I trust your judgment”(and mean them) it's like magic. Team members feel empowered. They take a risk. They grow. Trust is strengthened. And then it tends to spread. [190]</mark></p>
      <p>Every relationship has a structure, even if it's an unspoken, unclear one. A low-trust structure is one where expectations are unclear, where goals are incompatible or at odds, where people don't know who is doing what, where the rules are ambiguous and nobody knows what the standards for success are, and where the priorities are unclear and the incentives misaligned. [191]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. What is a problem that irritates me repeatedly?</p>
        <p>2. What is the total cost of managing that over several years?</p>
        <p>3. What is the next step I can take immediately, in a few minutes, to move toward solving it? [197]</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The goal is to find the most annoying thing that can be solved in the least amount of time. [197]</p>
      <p>The key to this process is time. The sooner you identify a problem, the more likely you are to avert a dangerous situation. [200]</p>

      <h2>Conclusion (Now)</h2>
      <p><mark>Life doesn't have to be as hard and complicated as we make it. [213]</mark></p>
