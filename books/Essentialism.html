      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>He would evaluate requests based on the timid criteria, "Can I actually fulfill this request, given the time and resources I have?" If the answer was no then he would refuse the request. [2]</p>
      <p>Is this the very most important thing I should be doing with my time and resources right now? [2]</p>
      <p>By being selective he bought himself space, and in that space he found creative freedom. [3]</p>
      <p>Only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter. [4]</p>
      <p>He is driven by the idea that almost everything is noise. He believes very few things are essential. His job is to filter through that noise until he gets to the essence. [4]</p>
      <p>Less but better. [5]</p>
      <p>There are far more activities and opportunities in the world than we have time and resources to invest in. And although many of them may be good, or even very good, the fact is that most are trivial and few are vital. [5]</p>
      <p><mark>If you don't prioritize your life, someone else will. [10]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>Success can distract us from focusing on the essential things that produce success in the first place. [13]</mark></p>
      <p>Falling into "the undisciplined pursuit of more" was a key reason for failure. [13]</p>
      <p>In the wardrobe of our lives, new clothes - new demands on our time - are coming at us constantly. Imagine if every time you opened the doors to your wardrobe you found that people had been shoving their clothes in there - if every day you cleaned it out in the morning and then by afternoon found it already stuffed to the brim. [19]</p>
      <p><mark>Almost everything is noise, and a very few things are exceptionally valuable. [20]</mark></p>
      <p>We can't have it all or do it all. If we could, there would be no reason to evaluate or eliminate options. [20]</p>
      <p>"Which problem do I want to solve?" [20]</p>
      <p>Systematically explore and evaluate a broad set of options before committing to any. [21]</p>

        <p><mark>In sacrificing my power to choose I had made a choice - a bad one. [34]</mark></p>
        <p>When we surrender our ability to choose, something or someone else will step in to choose for us. [35]</p>
        <p>A choice is not a thing, our options may be things, but a choice - a choice is an action. [35]</p>
        <p>While we may not always have control over our options, we always have control over how we choose among them. [35]</p>

        <p><mark>"What is the most valuable result I could achieve in this job?" [43]</mark></p>
        <p>You could massively improve the quality of a product by resolving a tiny fraction of the problems. [44]</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
        <p>Saying yes to any opportunity by definition requires saying no to several others. [52]</p>
        <p><mark>Essentialists ask the tougher but ultimately more liberating question, "Which problem do I want?" [55]</mark></p>

        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
        <p>"I think it's critical to set aside time to take a breath, look around, and think. You need that level of clarity in order to innovate and grow. Furthermore, he uses the meeting as a litmus test to alert him if employees are spending too much time on the non-essential: "If somebody can't make the meeting because of too much going on, that tells me either we're doing something inefficiently or we need to hire more people." If his people are too busy to think, then they're too busy, period. [64]</p>
        <p>Before you can evaluate what is and isn't essential, you first need to explore your options. [64]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
        <p>Non-Essentialists listen too. But they listen while preparing to say something. [77]</p>
        <p>In their eagerness to react they miss the point. [77]</p>
        <p>Play sparks exploration [77]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
        <p>The best asset we have for making a contribution to the world is ourselves. If we underinvest in ourselves, and by that I mean our minds, our bodies, and our spirits, we damage the very tool we need to make our highest contribution. [94]</p>
        <p><mark>The real challenge for the person who thrives on challenges is not to work hard [94]</mark></p>

        <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
        <p>If the answer isn't a definite yes then it should be a no. [103]</p>
        <p>Here's a simple, systematic process you can use to apply selective criteria to opportunities that come your way. First, write down the opportunity. Second, write down a list of three "minimum criteria" the options would need to "pass" in order to be considered. Third, write down a list of three ideal or "extreme criteria" the options would need to "pass" in order to be considered. By definition, if the opportunity doesn't pass the first set of criteria, the answer is obviously no. But if it also doesn't pass two of your three extreme criteria, the answer is still no. [111]</p>
        <p><mark>We aren't looking for a plethora of good things to do. We are looking for the one where we can make our absolutely highest point of contribution. [112]</mark></p>
        <p>As often happens to driven, ambitious people, his earlier success had distracted him from his clarity of purpose. [112]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
        <p><mark>The question you should be asking yourself is not: "What, of my list of competing priorities, should I say yes to?" [?]</mark></p>
        <p>Clarity of purpose so consistently predicts how people do their jobs. [121]</p>
        <p>Motivation and cooperation deteriorate when there is a lack of purpose. [121]</p>
        <p>If a team does not have clarity of goals and roles, problems will fester and multiply. [121]</p>
        <p>It was simple, concrete, inspiring, and easily measured. [126]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
        <p>Anyone can talk about the importance of focusing on the things that matter most - and many people do - but to see people who dare to live it is rare. [132-133]</p>
        <p>The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing [134]</p>
        <p><mark>They say yes automatically, without thinking, often in pursuit of the rush one gets from having pleased someone. [136]</mark></p>
        <p>The point is to say no to the non-essentials so we can say yes to the things that really matter. It is to say no - frequently and gracefully - to everything but what is truly vital. [137]</p>
        <p><mark>Separate the decision from the relationship. [137]</mark></p>
        <p>Denying the request is not the same as denying the person. [137]</p>
        <p>The more we think about what we are giving up when we say yes to someone, the easier it is to say no. [138]</p>
        <p>Remind yourself that everyone is selling something. [138]</p>
        <p>A clear "I am going to pass on this" is far better than not getting back to someone or stringing them along with some noncommittal answer. [139]</p>
        <p>We need to learn the slow 'yes' and the quick 'no’. [143]</p>

        <p>The endowment effect – our tendency to undervalue things that aren't ours and to overvalue things because we already own them. [148]</p>
        <p>Don't ask, “how will I feel if I miss out on this opportunity?" but rather, “if I did not have this opportunity, how much would I be willing to sacrifice in order to obtain it?" [149]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
        <p>Cut out things that confuse the reader and cloud the message or story. [158]</p>
        <p>Having fewer options actually makes a decision "easier on the eye and the brain.” [159]</p>
        <p><mark>The best surgeon is not the one who makes the most incisions; similarly, the best editors can sometimes be the least intrusive, the most restrained. [161-162]</mark></p>

        <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
        <p>Not pushing back costs more: our ability to choose what is most essential in life. [166]</p>
        <p>When we don't set clear boundaries in our lives we can end up imprisoned by the limits others have set for us. [169]</p>
        <p><mark>Once you've figured out which activities and efforts to keep in your life, you have to have a system for executing them. You can't wait until that wardrobe is bursting at the seams and then take superhuman efforts to purge it. You have to have a system in place so that keeping it neat becomes routine and effortless.

        <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
        <p>The only thing we can expect (with any great certainty) is the unexpected. Therefore, we can either wait for the moment and react to it or we can prepare. We can create a buffer. [176]</p>
        <p>The value of extreme preparation on a grander scale can be seen in the story of Roald Amundsen and Robert Falcon Scott in their race to be the first people in modern history to reach the South Pole. Both men had exactly the same objective. But their approaches differed. Amundsen prepared for anything and everything that could possibly go wrong; Scott hoped for the best-case scenario. [180]</p>
        <p>Of the variety of explanations for why we underestimate the amount of time something will take, I believe social pressure is the most interesting. One study found that if people estimated anonymously how long it would take to complete a task they were no longer guilty of the planning fallacy. [182]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
        <p>To attain knowledge add things every day. to attain wisdom subtract things every day. - Lao Tzu [185]</p>
        <p>Any improvement with Herbie, however small, will improve the pace of the whole team immediately. So he actually takes weight out of Herbie's backpack (the extra food and supplies he brought with him) and distributes it throughout the rest of the group. And indeed, this instantly improves the speed of the whole group. [186]</p>
        <p>If you really want to improve the overall functioning of the system - whether that system is a manufacturing process, a procedure in your department, or some routine in your daily life - you need to identify the "slowest hiker." [187]</p>
        <p><mark>A non-Essentialist approaches execution in a reactive, haphazard manner. Because the non-Essentialist is always reacting to crises rather than anticipating them, he is forced to apply quick-fix solutions. [187]</mark></p>

        <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
        <p>Instead of going for the big, flashy wins that don't really matter, the Essentialist pursues small and simple wins in areas that are essential. [195]</p>
        <p>Think of all of the big; hyped-up initiatives in organizations that never ended up amounting to anything. [196]</p>
        <p><mark>Of all forms of human motivation the most effective one is progress. [196]</mark></p>
        <p>The two primary internal motivators for people are achievement and recognition for achievement. [196]</p>
        <p><mark>The best place to look is for small changes we could make in the things we do often. [197]</mark></p>

        <h2>Chapter 18</h2>
        <p>Nearly 40 per cent of our choices are deeply unconscious. We don't think about them in the usual sense. There is both danger and opportunity in this. [209]</p>
        <p><mark>Focus on the hardest thing first. [211]</mark></p>

        <h2>Chapter 19</h2>
        <p>We can easily do two things at the same time, what we can't do is concentrate on two things at the same time. [220]</p>

        <p>Beware the barrenness of a busy life. - Socrates [225]</p>
        <p>If one's life is simple, contentment has to come. Simplicity is extremely important for happiness. [235]</p>

        <h2>Leadership Essentials</h2>
        <p>When teams lack clarity of purpose, it becomes difficult if not impossible to discern which of these myriad opportunities are truly vital. [240]</p>
        <p>One wrong hire is far costlier than being one person short. [243]</p>
        <p>Clear intent leads to alignment; vague direction produces misalignment every time. [244]</p>
        <p>Communicate the right things to the right people at the right time. [245]</p>
