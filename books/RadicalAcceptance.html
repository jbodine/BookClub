      <h2>Prologue</h2>
      <p>While I felt exposed and raw, I intuitively knew that by facing this pain I was entering a path of healing. [2]</p>
      <p>We don't have to wait until we are on our deathbed to realize what a waste of our precious lives it is to carry the belief that something is wrong with us. [3]</p>

        <h2>One</h2>
        <p>Because so many of us grew up without a cohesive and nourishing sense of family, neighborhood, community or "tribe," it is not surprising that we feel like outsiders, on our own and disconnected. [11]</p>
        <p>We exercise, take enriching courses of study, meditate, make lists, volunteer, take workshops. Certainly any of these activities can be undertaken in a wholesome way, but so often they are driven by anxious undercurrents of "not good enough." Rather than relaxing and enjoying who we are and what we're doing, we are comparing ourselves with an ideal and trying to make up for the difference. [15]</p>

        <h2>Two</h2>
        <p>The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change. -Carl Rogers [24]</p>
        <p>We lay the foundations of Radical Acceptance by recognizing when we are caught in the habit of judging, resisting and grasping, and how we constantly cry to control our levels of pain and plea-sure. [30]</p>
        <p>Times of great suffering can become times of profound spiritual insight and opening. Nearly all of us have faced seasons in our life where everything seemed to be falling apart. At these times, all the beliefs upon which we based our life are torn from their moorings; we thought we understood how to live life but now we feel lost in a stormy sea. As the storm quiets, we begin to see our life with freshness and a striking clarity. [37]</p>
        <p>Rather than trying to vanquish waves of emotion and rid ourselves of an inherently impure self, we turn around and embrace this life in all its realness broken, messy, mysterious and vibrantly alive. [42]</p>
        <p>I was manipulating my inner experience rather than being with what was actually happening. [43]</p>
        <p>Simply open and allow the changing stream of experience to move through me. When a harsh self-judgment appeared, I could recognize it simply as a passing thought. [43]</p>
        <p><mark>The boundary to what we can accept is the boundary to our freedom! [44]</mark></p>
        <p>When Ive been caught up in tension or self-judgment, I have stopped and asked myself, "What would it be like if I could accept life-accept this moment- exactly as it is?" [44-45]</p>
        <p>Thoughts are not the enemy, and you do not need to clear your mind of thoughts. Rather, you are developing the capacity to recognize when thoughts are happening without getting lost in the story line. [47]</p>
        <p><mark>The particular sensations, emotions or thoughts that arise when we practice mindfulness are not so important. It is our willingness to become still and pay attention to our experience, whatever it may be, that plants the seeds of Radical Acceptance. [48]</mark></p>

        <h2>Three</h2>
        <p>This tragic drama occurred several times until one of the pilots, Chuck Yeager, inadvertently struck upon a solution. When his plane began tumbling, Yeager was thrown violently around the cockpit and knocked out. Unconscious, he plummeted toward earth. Seven miles later, the plane reentered the planet's denser atmosphere, where standard navigation strategies could be implemented. Yeager came to, steadied the craft and landed safely. He had discovered the only lifesaving response that was possible in this desperate situation: Don't do anything. You take your hands off the controls. This solution, as Wolfe puts it, was "the only choice you had? It countered all training and even basic survival instincts, but it worked. [50]</p>
        <p>The more we fear failure the more frenetically our bodies and minds work. We fill our days with continual movement: mental planning and worrying, habitual talk-ing, fixing, scratching, adjusting, phoning, snacking, discarding buying, looking in the mirror. What would it be like if, right in the midst of this busyness, we were to consciously take our hands off the controls? [50-51]</p>
        <p><mark>Learning to pause is the first step in the practice of Radical Acceptance. A pause is a suspension of activity, a time of temporary disengagement when we are no longer moving toward any goal. [51]</mark></p>
        <p>Taking our hands off the controls and pausing is an opportunity to clearly see the wants and fears that are driving us. During the moments of a pause, we become conscious of how the feeling that something is missing or wrong keeps us leaning into the future, on our way somewhere else. [52]</p>
        <p>Pausing and accepting the intensity of my suffering was the only way I could have released the grip of trance. Often the moment when we most need to pause is exactly when it feels most intolerable to do so. [52]</p>
        <p><mark>Without opening to the actual experience of the moment, Radical Acceptance is not possible. [53]</mark></p>
        <p>This attitude of neither grasping nor pushing away any experience has come to be known as the Middle Way, and it characterizes the engaged presence we awaken in pausing. [60]</p>
        <p>In Sanskrit, mara means "delusion," the dreamlike ignorance that entangles us in craving and fear and obscures our enlightened nature. Traditional stories speak of Mara as appearing in many forms- violent storms, temptingly beautiful women, raging demons, massive armies. [60]</p>

        <h2>Four</h2>
        <p>We practice Radical Acceptance by pausing and then meeting whatever is happening inside us with this kind of unconditional friendliness. [75]</p>
        <p>Nothing is wrong-whatever is happening is just "real life”. [75]</p>
        <p><mark>We might also ask, "What wants my attention right now?" Or "What is asking for acceptance?" Then we attend, with genuine interest and care, listening to our heart, body and mind. [77]</mark></p>
        <p>I sometimes spend days being impatient and judgmental toward myself before I stop and pay attention to the feelings and beliefs that have been disconnecting me from my heart. When I do pause and look at what's happening, I realize that I've been caught up in the suffering of anxiety and self-doubt. [80]</p>
        <p>Recognizing that we are suffering is freeing-self-judgment falls away and we can regard ourselves with kindness. [81]</p>
        <p>I felt the inner freedom that comes from agreeing unconditionally to life. I was inviting Mara to tea. [82]</p>
        <p><mark>Trying to produce a biscuit—a life—with no dirty bowls, no messy feelings, no depression, no anger was so frustrating. [85]</mark></p>

        <h2>Five</h2>
        <p>Mindfulness of the body leads to happiness in this life, and the fullness of spiritual awakening. [97]</p>
        <p>We experience our lives through our bodies whether we are aware of it or not. [97]</p>
        <p>With the thought, there's also a sensation. You must not miss this root. [101]</p>
        <p>It is easy to feel that something bad will happen if we don't maintain our habitual vigilance by thinking, judging, planning. Yet this is the very habit that keeps us trapped in resisting life. Only when we realize we can't hold on to anything can we begin to relax our efforts to control our experience. [103]</p>
        <p>Mistrusting our bodies, we try to control them in the same way that we try to manage the natural world. [105]</p>
        <p><mark>Pain is the messenger we try to kill, not something we allow and embrace. [105]</mark></p>
        <p>Our healing comes from reconnecting with those places in our body where that pain is stored. [114-115]</p>
        <p>Suggested she pause and, feeling into her body, sense what was most asking for her attention and acceptance. [116]</p>
        <p>We discover, as Rumi writes, "The cure for the pain is in the pain." [117]</p>

        <h2>Six</h2>
        <p>Her question pointed me back to the essence of mindfulness practice: It doesn't matter what is happening. What matters is how we are relating to our experience. She advised me to stop fighting my experience and instead investigate the nature of wanting mind. [131]</p>
        <p>We need security, food and sex; emotional recognition and bonding; mental engagement and creative activity; communion and self-realization. Meeting these needs of body, mind and spirit gives us satisfaction and pleasure; denying them leaves us feeling deprived, frustrated and incomplete. We seek out experiences that enable us to survive, thrive and be fulfilled. [132]</p>
        <p>My love for what I do is clouded over when working becomes a strategy to prove my worth. [139]</p>
        <p>In the myth of Eden, God created the garden and dropped the tree of knowledge, with its delicious and dangerous fruits, right smack-dab in the middle. He then deposited some humans close by and forbade these curious, fruit-loving creatures from taking a taste. It was a setup. Eve naturally grasped at the fruit and then was shamed and punished for having done so. We experience this situation daily inside our own psyche. We are encouraged by our culture to keep ourselves comfortable, to be right, to possess things, to be better than others, to look good, to be admired. We are also told that we should feel ashamed of our selfishness, that we are flawed for being so self-centered, sinful when we are indulgent. [142]</p>
        <p>Reflect on an area of your life where you feel compelled by wanting mind. It might be food, cigarettes, alcohol, sex, voicing critical remarks, computer games, work or buying things. For one week let your intention be to practice pausing when you feel the urge to enact that behavior. [157]</p>
        <p><mark>By pausing and asking yourself at any moment, "What really matters? What do I most care about?" you awaken your naturally caring heart. [160]</mark></p>

        <h2>Seven</h2>
        <p>As we learn to say yes to fear, we reconnect with the fullness of being—the heart and awareness that have been overshadowed by the contraction of fear. [165]</p>
        <p>Regardless of the external circumstances my mind grows tight. When I pause and ask what is really bothering me, I realize that in each situation I am anticipating loss–loss of something I think is essential to my life and happiness. [167]</p>
        <p>We become, as Chögyam Trungpa puts it, "a bundle of tense muscles defending our existence." We often don't even recognize this armor because it feels like such a familiar part of who we are. But we can see it in others. And when we are meditating, we can feel it in ourselves-the tightness, the areas where we feel nothing. [169]</p>
        <p>As we feel our belonging to the natural rhythms of life, the illusion of being separate and threatened begins to dissolve. [177]</p>
        <p><mark>He was able to see that his thoughts were just thoughts, not the truth about how things were. [181]</mark></p>
        <p><mark>In a popular teaching story, a man being chased by a tiger leaps off a cliff in his attempt to get away. Fortunately, a tree growing on the side of the cliff breaks his fall. Dangling from it by one arm–tiger pacing above, jutting rocks hundreds of feet below—he yells out in desperation, "Help! Somebody help me!!" A voice responds, "Yes?" The man screams, "God, God, is that you?" Again, "Yes." Terrified, the man says, "God, I'll do anything, just please, please, help me." God responds, "Okay then, just let go!" The man pauses for a moment, then calls out, "Is anyone else there?" [185]</mark></p>
        <p>Remaining aware of the sensations of anxiety in his body, he asked himself, "What is really asking for attention?” [186]</p>
        <p>"You know, Tara, it's taken me a long time to realize that I can just hold her without trying to fix her." [190]</p>
        <p>When we come face-to-face with the fear and pain in our psyche, we stand at the gateway to tremendous renewal and freedom. Our deepest nature is awareness, and when we fully inhabit that, we love freely and are whole. This is the power of Radical Acceptance: When we stop fighting the energy that has been bound in fear, it naturally releases into the boundless sea of awareness. The more we awaken from the grip of fear, the more radiant and free becomes our heart. [192]</p>
        <p>Be aware of nearby sounds, noticing their beginnings and endings. Notice the spaces between sounds. Become aware of more far-off sounds, then open to the most distant sounds you can detect. [195]</p>
        <p>Bring to mind a situation that evokes fear. Ask yourself: "What is the worst part of this situation? What am I really afraid of?" While your inquiry may arouse a story, if you stay alert to the sensations that arise in your body, the story becomes a gateway to accessing your feelings more fully. [196]</p>
        <p>What does the fear actually feel like? Where in your body do you feel it most strongly? Do the sensations change or move to different parts of your body? What is their shape? [196]</p>

        <p>Radical Acceptance has two wings–compassion as well as mindfulness. We cannot be accepting of our experience if our heart has hardened in fear and blame. [199]</p>
        <p>Compassion begins with the capacity to hold your own life with a loving heart. [217]</p>

        <p><mark>As (father) Theophane focused on the needs of those he had been given to serve, he would recognize their vulnerability and longing for love—and realize that their needs were no different from his own. [227]</mark></p>
        <p>If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostility. [231]</p>
        <p>"My religion is kindness" [232]</p>
        <p>"What most mattered to our master?" he asked. The disciple smiled as he answered, "Whomever he was with at that moment." [232]</p>
        <p>In teaching compassion practices I sometimes ask students to choose someone they see regularly but are not personally involved with. When they have brought this person to mind, I invite them to consider, "What does he or she need?" "What does this person fear?" "What is life like for this person?" [233]</p>
        <p>As Mother Teresa teaches, "We can do no great things —only small things with great love." [242]</p>

        <p>To be ignorant is to ignore the truth that we are connected to all of life, and that grasping and hatred create more separation and suffering. [248]</p>
        <p>There is only one heroism in the world: to see the world as it is, and to love it. [249]</p>
        <p>Rather than forgiving a "self," we forgive the experiences we are identified with. [252]</p>
        <p>T. S. Eliot writes: What we know of other people, Is only our memory of the moments, During which we knew them. And they have Changed since then ... We must, Also remember, That at every meeting we are meeting a stranger. [265]</p>
        <p>When I'm feeling dislike for someone, I find it helpful to imagine that person being warmed and comforted in the embrace of someone who loves them. Or I might think of them as sincerely praying, or being filled with wonder as they walk through newly fallen snow. [267]</p>
        <p><mark>"May you accept yourself just as you are?" [269]</mark></p>
        <p>The Dalai Lama states: "One of my fundamental beliefs is that ... the basic human nature is gentleness. [270]</p>
        <p>Everybody just wants to be loved. [272]</p>
        <p>If you have wounded another person, did you act out of hurt and insecurity? Out of the need to feel power or safety? [275]</p>

        <h2>Eleven</h2>
        <p>Just my sincere question, "How are you?" opens the healing flood of tears. [284]</p>
        <p>When we’re on a spiritual path, we might feel that to be freed from our emotional struggles is a matter of meditating or praying more. But no matter how much we meditate or pray, we still need others to help us dismantle the walls of our isolation and remind us of our belonging. Remembering that we are connected to others and our world is the essence of healing. [285]</p>
        <p>While engaged in conversation, instead of immediately responding when someone speaks, we pause for a moment, relax our body and mind and mindfully notice what we are experiencing. We might in-quire, "What really wants attention?" and notice the feelings and thoughts that are arising. Are we judging or interpreting or commenting on what another person is saying? What sensations are we experiencing in our body? By pausing and paying attention we become acutely aware of our patterns of reaction. [290]</p>
        <p><mark>Sufi teacher Idries Shah tells the story of a dervish who was so wise and beloved that every time he sat down at one of his favorite coffeehouses, he would be immediately surrounded by students and devotees. While he was humble and did not proclaim to be someone special, these very qualities were part of the vibrant aura that attracted his followers. The dervish was asked various questions about spiritual life, but the most frequent was personal: "How did you become so holy?" Invariably he would simply reply, "I know what is in the Koran." This went on for quite a while until one day, after hearing this response, a rather arrogant newcomer challenged him. "Well, what is in the Koran?" he demanded. After regarding him kindly, the dervish responded, "In the Koran there are two pressed flowers, and a letter from my friend Abdullah." [301]</mark></p>

        <p>The process of realizing who we are is called a path of awakening. While a path implies getting somewhere else and different, in spiritual life the path opens us to the awareness and love that, as T. S. Eliot writes, is "here, now, always." [308]</p>
        <p>Holding on to anything including a sense of being the observer, obscures the full freedom of awareness." [313]</p>
