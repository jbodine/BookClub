      <h2>Preface</h2>
      <p>You don’t really find an audience for your work, they find you. [p.1]</p>
      <p>Almost all of the people I look up to and try to steal from today, regardless of their profession, have built sharing into their routine. [p.2]</p>
      <p>Instead of wasting their time “networking” they’re taking advantage of the network. [p.2]</p>
      <p>By generously sharing their ideas and their knowledge, they often gain an audience that they can then leverage when they need it–for fellowship, feedback, or patronage. [p.2]</p>
      <p><mark>This book is about how to influence others by letting them steal from you. [p.3]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>An “ecology of talent.” If you look back closely at history, many of the people who we think of as lone geniuses were actually part of “a whole scene of people who were supporting each other, looking at each other’s work, copy from each other, stealing ideas, and contributing ideas. [p.11]</p>
      <p>Creativity is always, in some sense, a collaboration, the result of a mind connected to other minds. [p.11]</p>
      <p>The amateur– the enthusiast who pursues her work in the spirit of love (in French, the word means “lover”), regardless of the potential for fame, money, or career–who often has the advantage over the professional. [p.15]</p>
      <p>Sometimes, amateurs have more to teach us than experts. “It often happens that two schoolboys can solve difficulties in their work for one another better than the master can” - C.S. Lewis [p.16]</p>
      <p><mark>The world is changing at such a rapid rate that it’s turning us all into amateurs. Even for professionals, the best way to flourish is to retain an amateur’s spirit and embrace uncertainty and the unknown. [p.18]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>The best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others. [p.19]</mark></p>
      <p>The only way to find your voice is to use it. It’s hardwired , built into you. Talk about the things you love. Your voice will follow. [p.21]</p>
      <p>It sounds a little extreme, but in this day and age, if your work isn’t online, it doesn’t exist. [p.23]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>Human beings are interested in other human beings and what other human beings do. [p.36]</p>
      <p>By putting things out there, consistently, you can form a relationship with your customers. It allows them to see the person behind the products. [p.38]</p>
      <p>“No one is going to give a damn about your resume; they want to see what you have made with your own little fingers.” - David Carr [p.41]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p>Overnight success is a myth. Dig into almost every overnight success story and you’ll find about a decades worth of hard work and perseverance. [p.47]</p>
      <p><mark>The day is the only unit of time that I can really get my head around. Seasons change, weeks are completely human-made, but the day has a rhythm.  [p.47]</mark></p>
