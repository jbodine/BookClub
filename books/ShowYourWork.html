      <h2>Preface</h2>
      <p>You don’t really find an audience for your work, they find you. [p.1]</p>
      <p>Almost all of the people I look up to and try to steal from today, regardless of their profession, have built sharing into their routine. [p.2]</p>
      <p>Instead of wasting their time “networking” they’re taking advantage of the network. [p.2]</p>
      <p>By generously sharing their ideas and their knowledge, they often gain an audience that they can then leverage when they need it–for fellowship, feedback, or patronage. [p.2]</p>
      <p><mark>This book is about how to influence others by letting them steal from you. [p.3]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>An “ecology of talent.” If you look back closely at history, many of the people who we think of as lone geniuses were actually part of “a whole scene of people who were supporting each other, looking at each other’s work, copy from each other, stealing ideas, and contributing ideas. [p.11]</p>
      <p>Creativity is always, in some sense, a collaboration, the result of a mind connected to other minds. [p.11]</p>
      <p>The amateur– the enthusiast who pursues her work in the spirit of love (in French, the word means “lover”), regardless of the potential for fame, money, or career–who often has the advantage over the professional. [p.15]</p>
      <p>Sometimes, amateurs have more to teach us than experts. “It often happens that two schoolboys can solve difficulties in their work for one another better than the master can” - C.S. Lewis [p.16]</p>
      <p><mark>The world is changing at such a rapid rate that it’s turning us all into amateurs. Even for professionals, the best way to flourish is to retain an amateur’s spirit and embrace uncertainty and the unknown. [p.18]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>The best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others. [p.19]</mark></p>
      <p>The only way to find your voice is to use it. It’s hardwired , built into you. Talk about the things you love. Your voice will follow. [p.21]</p>
      <p>It sounds a little extreme, but in this day and age, if your work isn’t online, it doesn’t exist. [p.23]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>Human beings are interested in other human beings and what other human beings do. [p.36]</p>
      <p>By putting things out there, consistently, you can form a relationship with your customers. It allows them to see the person behind the products. [p.38]</p>
      <p>“No one is going to give a damn about your resume; they want to see what you have made with your own little fingers.” - David Carr [p.41]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p>Overnight success is a myth. Dig into almost every overnight success story and you’ll find about a decades worth of hard work and perseverance. [p.47]</p>
      <p><mark>The day is the only unit of time that I can really get my head around. Seasons change, weeks are completely human-made, but the day has a rhythm.  [p.47]</mark></p>
      <p>If you’re in the very early stages, share your influences and what’s inspiring you. If you’re in the middle of executing a project, write about your methods or share works in progress. If you’ve just completed a project, show the final product, share scraps from the cutting-room floor, or write about what you learned. [p.48]</p>
      <p>"What are you working on?" Stick to that question and you'll be good. Don't show your lunch or your latte; show your work. [p.52]</p>
      <p>90 percent of everything is crap. [p.54]</p>
      <p>I like to work while the world is sleeping, and share while the world is at work." [p.54]</p>
      <p>Be open, share imperfect and unfinished work that you want feedback on, but don't share absolutely everything. [p.57]</p>
      <p><mark>A lot of the ideas in this book started out as tweets, which then became blog posts, which then became book chapters. Small things, over time, can get big. [p.64]</mark></p>
      <p>One little blog post is nothing on its own, but publish a thousand blog posts over a decade, and it turns into your life's work. [p.66]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      <p>All it takes to uncover hidden gems is a clear eye, an open mind, and a willingness to search for inspiration in places other people aren't willing or able to go. [p.81]</p>
      <p>Being open and honest about what you like is the best way to connect with people who like those things, too. [p.83]</p>
      <p>You should always share the work of others as if it were your own, treating it with respect and care. [p.84]</p>
      <p>Attribution is all about providing context for what you're sharing: what the work is, who made it, how they made it, when and where it was made, why you're sharing it, why people should care about it, and where people can see some more work like it. [p.85]</p>
      <p>The number one rule of the Internet: People are lazy. If you don't include a link, no one can click it. [p.87]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      <p><mark>"When shown an object, or given a food, or shown a face, people's assessment of it-how much they like it, how valuable it is–is deeply affected by what you tell them about it. [p.92]</mark></p>
      <p><mark>our work doesn't speak for itself. Human beings want to know where things came from, how they were made, and who made them. The stories you tell about the work you do have a huge effect on how people feel and what they understand about your work, and how people feel and what they understand about your work affects how they value it. [p.93]</mark></p>
      <p>A character wants something, goes after it despite opposition (perhaps including his own doubts), and so arrives at a win, lose, or draw. [p.99]</p>
      <p><mark>Whether you're telling a finished or unfinished story, always keep your audience in mind. Speak to them directly in plain language. Value their time. Be brief. [p.101]</mark></p>
      <p>"Autobiography is only to be trusted when it reveals something disgraceful." - George Orwell [p.108]</p>
      <p>We all like to think we're more complex than a two-sentence explanation, but a two-sentence explanation is usually what the world wants from us. Keep it short and sweet. [p.108-109]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
      <p>Teaching doesn't mean instant competition. Just because you know the master's technique doesn't mean you're going to be able to emulate it right away. [p.116]</p>
      <p>"Make people better at something they want to be better at." - Kathy Sierra [p.117]</p>
      <p>When you teach someone how to do your work, you are, in effect, generating more interest in your work. [p.119]</p>
      <p><mark>when you share your knowledge and your work with others, you receive an education in return. [p.119]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
      <p>"When people realize they're being listened to, they tell you things." -Richard Ford [p.122]</p>
      <p>If you want fans, you have to be a fan first. [p.127]</p>
      <p>If you're only pointing to your own stuff online, you're doing it wrong. [p.127]</p>
      <p>Don't talk to people you don't want to talk to, and don't talk about stuff you don't want to talk about. [p.129]</p>
      <p>"Whatever excites you, go do it. Whatever drains you, stop doing it." -Derek Sivers [p.133]</p>
      <p>If, after hanging out with someone you feel worn out and depleted, that person is a vampire. If, after hanging out with someone you still feel full of energy, that person is not a vampire. Of course, The Vampire Test works on many things in our lives, not just people—you can apply it to jobs, hobbies, places, etc. [p.135-136]</p>
      <p>"Knuckleballers don't keep secrets. It's as if we have a greater mission beyond our own fortunes. And that mission is to pass it on, to keep the pitch alive." [p.139]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
      <p>Fear is often just the imagination taking a wrong turn. [p.151]</p>
      <p>If you spend your life avoiding vulnerability, you and your work will never truly connect with other people. [p.152]</p>
      <p>remember that your work is something you do, not who you are. [p.152]</p>
      <p>You want feedback from people who care about you and what you do. Be extra wary of feedback from anybody who falls outside of that circle. [p.154]</p>
      <p>Delete nasty comments. [p.157]</p>
      <p>Having a form for comments is the same as inviting comments. [p.157]</p>
      <p><mark>"When you get to the end of a book, you don't have to see what everyone else thought of it." [p.157]</mark></p>

      <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
      <p>"An amateur is an artist who supports himself with outside jobs which enable him to paint," said artist Ben Shahn. "A professional is someone whose wife works to enable him to paint." [p.161]</p>
      <p>Don't be jealous when the people you like do well. [p.163]</p>
      <p>Be ambitious. Keep yourself busy. [p.174]</p>
      <p>If an opportunity comes along that would mean more money, but less of the kind of work you want to do, say No. [p.174]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
      <p>The people who get what they're after are very often the ones who just stick around long enough. It's very important not to quit prematurely. [p.183]</p>
      <p><mark>As every author knows, your last book isn't going to write your next one for you. [p.187]</mark></p>
      <p>Author Ernest Hemingway would stop in the middle of a sentence at the end of his day's work so he knew where to start in the morning. [p.187]</p>
      <p>when our mind gets relaxed, it opens up to having new thoughts. [p.194]</p>
      <p>It's very important to separate your work from the rest of your life. [p.194]</p>
